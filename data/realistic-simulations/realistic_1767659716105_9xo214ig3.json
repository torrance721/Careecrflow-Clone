Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to speak with us. I'm [Your Name], and I head up the Digital Strategy team here.\n\nWe've been really impressed with your background during your three years as a Marketing Specialist—it’s clear you’ve driven some significant results. We’re excited about this Digital Marketing Manager role because it’s a crucial position focused on both execution and strategic client leadership.\n\nOur goal today is just to have a conversational deep dive into your experience and how you see yourself growing into a managerial role. Please feel free to ask me any questions at any point.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n## First Interview Question\n\n\"Great. To start, I'd love to hear a bit more about your journey.

How would your philosophy of delegating based on competence and not just availability translate when you have two competing, high-priority client deliverables that both require the same senior resource?\n\nYour delegation example involved managing low-stakes reporting for an intern team. GrowthSpark manages 8-10 high-value client campaigns simultaneously, often involving complex cross-functional deliverables like a full-scale website migration or a major product launch. Can you describe a specific instance where you had to delegate a high-stakes, complex project (not just reporting) across multiple specialists, where resources were constrained and competing client priorities were involved?

However, this relies on reactive mitigation rather than systemic prevention. For a senior leadership role, we need solutions that reduce the frequency and severity of these resource conflicts. Beyond the immediate triage, what specific systemic changes or processes did you implement *after* this incident to prevent future critical resource bottlenecks with specialists like Mark?
