Let's set the scene for the interview.\n\n***\n\n## Interview Opening\n\n**(Interviewer Tone: Warm, enthusiastic, and professional)**\n\n\"Hi [Candidate Name], welcome! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. I’m [Your Name], and I lead the BI Strategy team here at Global Consumer Analytics.\n\nWe’re genuinely excited about this role because it sits right at the intersection of data and business impact, helping our biggest clients understand what drives consumer behavior globally.\n\nBefore we dive into the technical details, I just want to say that we really appreciate you making the jump from Junior Data Analyst to a more strategic BI role—it shows great ambition. We want this conversation to be collaborative, so please feel free to ask me questions at any point.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n## First Interview Question\n\n**Question Focus:** Moving from descriptive analysis (Junior role) to strategic thinking and project ownership (Mid-Level BI role).\n\n\"Fantastic. Let’s start with a foundational question to understand your approach to problem-solving.\n\nBased on your experience over the past three years, you’ve likely worked on many projects where data was used to answer a specific business question.\n\n**Could you walk me through a project where you were tasked with analyzing a business problem—perhaps a sudden drop in sales for a key product line or a shift in consumer engagement—and describe the steps you took, from initial data gathering and cleaning all the way through to delivering a clear, actionable recommendation to stakeholders?**\n\nWe're particularly interested in how you identified the *root cause* and how you ensured your final insights were easy for a non-technical audience to understand.\"",

My approach was structured into four phases: Define, Analyze, Model, and Communicate. First, I defined the scope and used SQL to pull event logs and user demographics from PostgreSQL, cleaning the data in Pandas to ensure consistency. The analysis phase revealed that the drop was disproportionately concentrated among users who had recently interacted with a newly launched marketing campaign promoting a \"simplified dashboard.\"\n\nUsing Scikit-learn, I built a logistic regression model correlating campaign exposure, feature usage, and churn risk, which confirmed the simplified dashboard was unintentionally hiding key metrics that power users relied on. The root cause was a UI change that optimized for new users but alienated existing high-value customers. My actionable recommendation was to implement a toggle feature allowing users to switch between the simplified view and the detailed view, which we then A/B tested.

It's clear you have a strong grasp of the practical trade-offs involved in A/B methodology.\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground today, from your approach to data modeling to the nuances of statistical power. That concludes the formal question portion of the interview. I'd like to pivot now and give you the opportunity to ask any final questions you have for me or the team.\n\nThank you for your thoughtful responses.
