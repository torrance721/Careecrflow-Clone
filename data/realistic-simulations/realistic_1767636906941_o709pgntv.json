We’ve been very impressed with your background; 12 years in product marketing is a substantial achievement, and your experience aligns well with the complexity of our global portfolio.\"\n\n\"My name is [Interviewer Name], and I lead the Global Marketing Strategy team. We are incredibly excited about this Director role. It’s a pivotal position that sits right at the intersection of creation, commerce, and brand narrative. At Chanel, our products are more than just items—they are embodiments of our heritage and future.\"\n\n\"Before we dive into the specifics of the role, I’d love to hear a bit more about what drives you. You’ve had a successful career as a Senior Product Marketing Manager. **What specifically drew you to this Director of Global Product Marketing role at Chanel, and what do you believe is the single biggest difference between managing a product marketing strategy and truly leading a global product marketing vision?**\"",

The 40% alienation metric was derived using a weighted qualitative scoring model, where four key themes (lack of personalization, reduced exclusivity, packaging changes, and loyalty tier confusion) were assigned a severity score; 40% represents the aggregate score exceeding the 'high dissatisfaction' threshold across that segment. Regarding the 500-customer survey, the response rate was 68%, achieved through personalized outreach via our concierge service, which allowed us to maintain the stated 4% margin of error.

To address your points sequentially: The 75 'high-value' customers were defined as our top 1% by spend—specifically, an average annual spend of €15,000 and an average tenure of 8.5 years. The 40% alienation metric was derived using a weighted qualitative scoring model, where four key themes (lack of personalization, reduced exclusivity, packaging changes, and loyalty tier confusion) were assigned a severity score; 40% represents the aggregate score exceeding the 'high dissatisfaction' threshold across that segment. Regarding the 500-customer survey, the response rate was 68%, achieved through personalized outreach via our concierge service, which allowed us to maintain the stated 4% margin of error. The calculated statistical power was 0.85, confirming the reliability of the findings that ultimately led us to overhaul our loyalty program and recover €3M in projected churn.",

Given these constraints, how would you strategically allocate the remaining resources—prioritizing between maintaining global consistency, investing in the localized initiatives suggested by the 40% alienation figure, or pursuing the high-risk, high-reward strategy implied by the early revenue projection—and what is the single metric you would use to justify your final portfolio decision to the board?",
