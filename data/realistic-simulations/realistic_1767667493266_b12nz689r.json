Situation: Anya is currently employed but feels her growth potential is limited at her current B2B company, which prioritizes function over design innovation. She is eager to transition to a consumer-facing, design-first organization like Figma. She has been actively 'mass applying' (海投) for the last two months, sending out over 40 applications to top-tier tech companies.

We’re all really excited to chat with you—we’ve been impressed with your portfolio and your background at [Mention a previous company/type of company if known, or just 'your previous roles'].\n\nAt Figma, we truly believe that design is about solving complex problems through collaboration and deep user understanding, and we're always looking for designers who are passionate about the craft and the community.\n\nThis conversation is really a chance for us to get to know you better, understand how you approach your work, and for you to ask us any questions you have about life here at Figma. Please feel free to relax; this is a discussion, not a test!\n\nReady to jump in?\n\n***\n\n### First Interview Question\n\nTo kick things off, could you walk me through your background and career journey so far? Specifically, I'm interested in hearing about what initially drew you to product design, and what you feel is the most significant shift or lesson you’ve learned in your three years as a designer.",

I quickly transitioned from general UI tasks to focusing on high-impact features, like leading the redesign of our core analytics dashboard. That project was a significant lesson; we initially focused too much on feature parity, but after integrating deep user research and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1), we saw a measurable 25% increase in daily active use. The most significant shift I've learned is that design success hinges less on the initial concept and more on establishing scalable processes, like building a robust design system in Figma, which cut our development handoff time by 15%.

Finally, the critical enforcement mechanism was a custom linting rule integrated into our Storybook environment; if an engineer tried to use a non-compliant brand token like `color-teal-500` within a component tagged as a data visualization, the build would fail, ensuring systematic adherence before deployment.

We approached this in three phases: documentation, tokenization, and enforcement. First, we created detailed documentation within ZeroHeight, clearly defining the 'Data Palette' as distinct from the 'Brand Palette,' specifying usage rules and mandatory WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all data visualizations. Second, we implemented semantic design tokens in Figma, prefixing all accessible data colors with `data-viz-` (e.g., `data-viz-primary-series`) and restricting engineers to only these tokens for chart components. Finally, the critical enforcement mechanism was a custom linting rule integrated into our Storybook environment; if an engineer tried to use a non-compliant brand token like `color-teal-500` within a component tagged as a data visualization, the build would fail, ensuring systematic adherence before deployment. This mechanism reduced color-related accessibility bugs in the analytics dashboard by 90% within the first quarter.",

Their ability to quantify design impact, particularly in complex areas like accessibility and design systems, is a significant strength. They possess the technical rigor required for a platform like Figma, although their experience is currently rooted in B2B SaaS.",
