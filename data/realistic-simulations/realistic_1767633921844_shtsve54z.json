I’m [Your Name], and I lead the design team focusing on our patient engagement platform. We’re really excited about this role—it’s a critical position as we expand our digital offerings.\n\nWe’ve reviewed your portfolio and your journey transitioning from a Junior UX Designer, and it’s clear you have a strong foundation in user research and interaction design.\n\nToday, we want to get to know you better, understand how you approach complex problems, and see how your process aligns with the collaborative, high-impact environment here at NextGen Health. Please feel free to ask us any questions throughout the interview. We want this to be a conversation, not an interrogation!\n\n***\n\n### The First Interview Question\n\nTo kick things off and help us understand your design philosophy:\n\n**\"Could you walk us through a recent project where you felt you made the biggest impact, specifically focusing on the transition from identifying a user problem to delivering a final, measurable solution? What was your role in driving that process forward?\"**",

We had so many support tickets piling up, and after doing some quick user interviews and looking at the heatmaps, we realized users couldn't find the 'Submit Final Report' button, which sounds simple, but it was buried deep in a sidebar menu that nobody ever opened. I led the initial discovery phase, using Figma for rapid prototyping to test three different navigation flows, and we ultimately moved that crucial action button to a persistent header bar, which was a huge win. The measurable result was fantastic: we saw a 25% increase in user engagement with the reporting features within the first month, and those specific usability support tickets dropped by about 15%, proving that sometimes the smallest design change makes the biggest impact, you know?",

But, because the legacy backend system was built on this super old API structure, the engineering team basically said that implementing the real-time functionality would delay the launch by six months and blow the budget completely. So, we pivoted; instead of real-time, we designed a simpler, accessible modal window with defined dropdowns for reallocation, which wasn't as visually exciting, but it reduced the cognitive load and still achieved the core goal of reducing misallocated tasks, which cut down support tickets related to that issue by 15% overall.
