Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. I’m [Your Name], and I lead the Platform Reliability team here at StellarTech.\n\nWe’re really excited about this role—it’s critical for scaling our core services reliably. Looking at your background, especially your five years in DevOps, you’ve clearly built a strong foundation in automation and infrastructure as code.\n\nToday, we want to talk less about *what* you've done and more about *how* you approach complex problems, especially those related to system stability and scaling. Please feel free to treat this as a collaborative conversation, not just a formal Q&A.\n\nDo you have any quick questions for me before we dive in?\"\n\n*(Wait for a brief response/confirmation)*\n\n### First Interview Question (The \"Transition Question\")\n\n\"Great. To kick things off and get a sense of your perspective on reliability, let’s start with a foundational concept.\n\n**In your experience transitioning from a pure DevOps focus to a Senior Site Reliability Engineering mindset, how do you define the difference between 'DevOps' and 'SRE'? Specifically, where does the focus shift when you are accountable for the *reliability* of a critical production system, and what metrics or practices become more important as a result?\"**",

We subsequently performed a retrospective power analysis, which indicated the test had only 45% power to detect a 40-incident reduction, highlighting that the sample size (n=12 weeks) was insufficient. This non-significant result prompted us to extend the observation period to 12 weeks post-change, where a subsequent one-tailed t-test *did* establish a statistically significant reduction, allowing us to confidently proceed with scaling the optimization.",

I appreciate you walking through that entire decision chain.\n\nWe've covered a significant amount of ground today, from your strategic vision for mitigating technical debt to the granular details of your process validation methodologies. That concludes the formal questions I had prepared for you. Now, I'd like to transition into the final segment, where we can discuss next steps and give you the opportunity to ask any remaining questions you might have for us.\n\nWe've covered a lot of ground today.
