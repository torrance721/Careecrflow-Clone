Here is the suggested opening and the first interview question, designed to be warm, professional, and directly relevant to the candidate's background.\n\n***\n\n## Mock Interview Opening\n\n**(Interviewer: [Your Name])**\n\n\"Hi [Candidate Name], thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I’m [Your Name], and I lead the Growth PM team for our digital investment platforms here at Fidelity.\n\nI've been really looking forward to this conversation, especially given your strong background in Senior Marketing Strategy. It's fascinating how much the worlds of marketing and product growth are converging, and your experience is exactly what we look for when we try to bridge the gap between acquisition and long-term customer value.\n\nThis interview is really just a conversation for us to understand your perspective on growth, and for you to understand how we operate here at Fidelity. Please feel free to ask me any questions at any point.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n## First Interview Question\n\n**The Goal of the Question:** To transition the candidate from a marketing mindset (acquisition) to a product mindset (retention and feature integration), while leveraging their existing expertise.\n\n\"Great. To start, I’d love to hear more about your journey.\n\nYou’ve spent six years driving strategy as a Senior Marketing Strategist, which means you’re an expert in identifying target audiences, crafting compelling value propositions, and driving acquisition.\n\nNow, as we look at the Growth Product Manager role here at Fidelity, the focus shifts slightly—we’re concerned with what happens *after* the customer signs up. We need to ensure they activate, engage, and ultimately stay.\n\n**Can you walk me through a specific time where you identified a significant drop-off point in the customer journey *after* the initial acquisition, and how you shifted your focus from a pure marketing solution to recommending a product or feature change to solve that problem?\"**",

My core competency is identifying waste and friction points using data.\n\nAt my previous agency, we ran acquisition for a fintech client targeting small business owners. We successfully drove high-volume sign-ups via paid social, but I noticed a significant 45% drop-off rate between account creation and the first successful transaction—the critical activation metric. My initial thought was to optimize the onboarding email flow, but the data, specifically SQL queries joining acquisition source with activation logs, showed the drop-off clustered around users who signed up but hadn't yet linked their bank account. We modeled this friction point and found that users who linked their accounts within the first 24 hours had a 75% higher LTV. Instead of more marketing, I recommended the product team implement a mandatory, simplified micro-deposit verification step *during* the sign-up flow, coupled with a minimal $5 incentive upon successful linking. This product change, which we A/B tested, reduced the drop-off by 22 percentage points within one quarter.",

To address the robustness of the DiD setup, we employed three key methods, acknowledging that the $0.42\\%$ pre-trend was indeed visually concerning initially.\n\nFirst, regarding the Falsification Test precision: the standard error for that pseudo-treatment coefficient was $0.015$, placing the 95% confidence interval between $-0.0258$ and $+0.0342$. This wide interval, driven by a modest sample size of $N=1,200$ weekly observations, confirms that $0.42\\%$ was well within the noise threshold, but yes, the power to detect smaller divergences was limited.\n\nSecond, to mitigate unobserved confounders, we ran a Synthetic Control Method (SCM) as a secondary validation, utilizing a weighted average of three similar control regions, which provided a more robust counterfactual than the simple average used in the initial DiD.\n\nFinally, we performed a placebo test by randomly assigning the treatment date two weeks earlier, confirming that the estimated treatment effect remained statistically insignificant before the actual intervention, thereby strengthening the validity of the parallel trends assumption against time-varying unobserved factors.",
