I’m [Your Name], and I lead the Data Science team focused on [mention a relevant ByteDance area, e.g., user growth/content recommendation/monetization].\n\nWe’re really excited about this role. Given your background at [Previous Company] as a Data Science Associate, we see a lot of potential alignment with the challenges we’re currently tackling here at ByteDance, particularly around scaling our recommendation systems and measuring true user impact.\n\nI want this to be a conversational process. Feel free to ask questions as we go.\n\nTo kick things off, I’d love to hear a bit more about your journey.\n\n**Can you walk me through your career path so far, highlighting one specific project from the last year where you moved beyond standard analysis to drive a measurable business outcome? Focus specifically on the problem you solved, the metric you optimized, and the technical approach you chose.**\"",
