Situation: Kenji is seeking a new challenge after 10 years in traditional logistics and manufacturing.

Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today. I’m [Your Name], and I lead a team within Fulfillment Strategy focused on optimizing our middle-mile network.\n\nI’ve had a chance to review your background, and your 10 years as a Supply Chain Operations Manager are highly relevant to the scale and complexity we deal with here at Amazon. We’re looking forward to hearing how your experience in managing day-to-day operations translates into developing long-term strategic initiatives.\n\nThis interview is designed to be a conversation. We'll spend the next hour discussing your background, diving into some specific examples of your work, and exploring how you apply strategic thinking to complex logistics problems. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have along the way.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n### First Interview Question\n\n\"Great. To start, I’d love to hear about a time you had to pivot from an operational focus to a strategic one.\n\n**Can you walk me through a major operational challenge your team faced that you realized could not be solved by simply optimizing existing processes? What was the underlying strategic problem, and what long-term, high-level solution did you design and champion to address it?**\"",
