Can you quantify that instability for me? When you identified that the GBM was failing, what was the specific, measurable impact on the business or patient outcomes—was it a 10% increase in false positives, a 0.05 drop in AUC on specific cohorts, or something else? Understanding the precise failure mode is critical to justifying the architectural complexity of moving to TCNs. Moving forward, let's discuss the architecture itself: specifically, how did you structure the data pipelines and model serving layer to ensure that the TCNs were not only fast but also continuously trained and monitored effectively in that high-stakes environment?\n\nYou mentioned the GBM model suffered from 'poor predictive stability' due to missing 'long-range dependencies.' Can you quantify this instability? Specifically, what was the measured degradation in performance (e.g., AUC drop, F1 variance) when tested on patient cohorts with dependency lags exceeding the GBM's feature window? Furthermore, describe one concrete example of a clinically relevant 'long-range dependency' that the TCN successfully captured, detailing the specific temporal span and the resulting improvement in a critical metric like False Negative Rate.",

However, achieving 78ms with INT8 quantization and pruning suggests a fairly large initial model configuration. To fully justify the architectural pivot to the TCN, we need to understand the constraints you were working under. What were the specific architectural parameters—the layer depth, the hidden state size, and the input sequence length—that resulted in that 78ms latency, and why were those specific dimensions considered the minimum viable configuration for the required AUC?\n\nAchieving 78 milliseconds with an aggressively optimized, pruned, and INT8 quantized LSTM suggests a substantial model size was still necessary for the required AUC. To fully justify the pivot to the TCN, we need to understand the configuration that failed. Can you specify the exact architecture of that optimized LSTM model—specifically, the number of layers, the hidden state size, and the input sequence length it was processing? Furthermore, what was the resulting parameter count and FLOPs of that 78ms model, and how did that compare to the initial, unoptimized baseline?",
