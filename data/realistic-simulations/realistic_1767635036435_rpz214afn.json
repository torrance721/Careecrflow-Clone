It’s genuinely great to finally connect with you. I’m [Your Name], and I lead the Marketing organization here at Global Wellness Corp. We’ve been incredibly impressed by your background, particularly your deep experience scaling products during your 12 years as a Senior PMM.\n\nBefore we jump into the specifics, I want to take a moment to set the stage. We’re excited about the future of wellness, and the Director of Product Marketing role is absolutely critical—it’s the nexus between our product innovation and bringing that value proposition successfully to market globally.\n\nOur goal today is twofold: for us to understand how your strategic vision aligns with our mission, and equally important, for you to get a clear sense of our culture and the impact you could have here. Please feel free to treat this as a conversation, and ask any questions you have along the way.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n---\n\n### First Interview Question\n\n\"Fantastic. To start, let’s talk about the transition from managing a product line to leading the entire strategic function.\n\n**Given your extensive experience, how do you define the role of a Director of Product Marketing, and specifically, what are the top three strategic priorities you would establish for the PMM team within your first 90 days at Global Wellness Corp?\"**",

Second, I would establish a **Cross-Functional Alignment Framework** to standardize the GTM process, specifically focusing on Sales Enablement materials and training to reduce sales cycle time by 15%.

What metric directly measures the *quality* of the leads generated relative to the product's readiness or capacity? Consider a metric that links Marketing's output (pipeline) directly to Operations' input (delivery capability). For Operations/HR, since the goal is internal resource efficiency, focus on how the incentive structure (HR) and process optimization (Operations) ensure the right people are working on the funded initiatives.
