Thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today. I’m [Your Name], and I lead the BI team here at Global Consumer Goods Corp.\n\nWe’re genuinely excited about this role. It's a critical position focused on helping our brand managers move beyond just *what* happened, to understanding *why* it happened and *what we should do next*.\n\nI’ve had a chance to look over your resume, and your three years as a Junior Data Analyst seem to have given you a strong foundation in data manipulation and reporting. We appreciate you making the jump to a more strategic BI role.\n\nMy goal today is to learn more about your experience, how you approach problem-solving, and what you’re looking for in your next career step. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have along the way.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n## First Interview Question (The \"Stepping Up\" Question)\n\n\"To get us started, I’d love to hear about a specific project or initiative from your previous role where you were asked to deliver a standard report, but you realized the stakeholders actually needed something deeper—a true insight or recommendation.\n\n**Can you walk me through that situation? Specifically, how did you identify the underlying business question, and what was the final, actionable insight you delivered that went beyond the basic data request?\"**",

The final, actionable insight was a recommendation to roll back a recent UI change on the login screen, which subsequently reduced the failed login rate by 18% within the next quarter and significantly improved the true positive rate of the churn model.",
