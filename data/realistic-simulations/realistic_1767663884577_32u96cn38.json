Situation: I'm currently working at a startup, but the environment is too unstable, and the growth opportunities are limited. I need to move into a larger, more established company to utilize my Master's degree fully. I've been applying to 30+ Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles across major tech and finance companies (海投) and need to practice explaining my statistical projects clearly and concisely before the screening calls start next week.",

I'm [Your Name], a Lead Data Scientist here on the Customer Insights team. We're all really excited about the possibility of you joining us.\n\nBefore we dive into the technical details, I just want to say thank you for taking the time to speak with us today. I know you've spent the last year as a Junior Data Analyst, and that experience is exactly the kind of foundational knowledge we look for.\n\nToday, we're going to spend about 45 minutes together. I'll ask you a mix of behavioral and technical questions, and then we'll leave plenty of time at the end for you to ask me anything about the role, the team, or GlobalMart.\n\nMy goal is to understand how you approach problems and how you think critically about data, especially in a fast-paced e-commerce environment. Please feel free to take a moment to gather your thoughts before answering any question.\n\nSound good?\"\n\n---\n\n## First Interview Question (Natural & Welcoming)\n\n\"Great. To start, let's talk a little bit about your current role.\n\nYou've spent the last year working with real-world data. Can you tell me about a specific project or analysis you completed where the initial data you received was messy, incomplete, or required significant cleaning?\n\n**What was the business question you were trying to answer, what steps did you take to clean and prepare that data, and what was the final impact of your findings?**\"",

Ultimately, these findings informed the Product team, leading to the deployment of a new in-app tutorial which subsequently decreased the identified early-stage churn by 4 percentage points.",

(e.g., Did you look forward, backward, or only match if the IP/Device ID pair was unique in that window?)\n\n2. **The Validation/Guardrails:** How did you specifically prevent the 'accidental merge' of users? Think about the potential pitfalls of shared IP addresses (like office networks or public Wi-Fi). What threshold or heuristic did you use to be confident that an imputed ID was correct?"

Based on this finding, we proposed and implemented a targeted intervention strategy. We worked with the product team to introduce a real-time notification system and an in-app troubleshooting guide triggered immediately after the second failed transaction. This small change resulted in a measurable reduction: the cohort that received the proactive notification showed a 12% lower churn rate compared to the control group in the pilot phase, directly influencing our customer retention roadmap for Q4.",
