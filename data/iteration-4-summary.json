Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. I’m \\[Your Name], and I lead the Global R&D Strategy team here at Novartis. We are incredibly excited about this role, as it sits right at the intersection of groundbreaking science and critical business decision-making.\n\nWe’ve been very impressed with your extensive background, particularly your 15 years as a Lead Research Scientist in Oncology. Your deep domain expertise is clearly exceptional.\n\nNow, as we kick off, I’d like to start with a question that helps us understand your perspective on this transition.\n\n### First Interview Question\n\n\"You’ve spent your career deeply immersed in the execution and discovery phase of oncology research. The VP of Global R&D Strategy role, however, requires a shift in focus—moving from *doing the science* to *deciding which science to do* and how to strategically allocate resources across a diverse portfolio.\n\n**Considering this transition, how do you plan to leverage your deep scientific expertise in oncology to influence and shape high-level, global R&D strategy, while ensuring you maintain the necessary strategic distance to objectively evaluate opportunities outside of your immediate therapeutic area of expertise?\"**",

First, my 15 years in oncology execution provide an invaluable, grounded perspective on technical feasibility, risk assessment, and realistic timelines—I know precisely where the bottlenecks occur. Second, I will leverage my expertise in complex genomic data analysis and clinical trial design to establish rigorous, data-driven metrics for portfolio prioritization, moving beyond anecdotal evidence to objective decision frameworks. For instance, when leading the Phase III trials for the novel immuno-oncology therapy at BioGen, I was required to strategically deprioritize a promising but statistically underpowered biomarker sub-study to ensure the primary endpoint remained achievable and compliant with FDA guidance. This experience demonstrates the ability to make difficult, objective trade-offs under high pressure. Finally, to maintain strategic distance outside oncology, I will rely on establishing strong, cross-functional partnerships with therapeutic area experts, using my regulatory and statistical background to challenge assumptions and standardize evaluation criteria across the entire global pipeline.",

Now, let's shift focus entirely to the portfolio itself. Novartis is committed to bold moves and pioneering science, and as VP of Global R&D Strategy, you are responsible for optimizing a multi-billion dollar pipeline across diverse therapeutic areas. How do you define and measure 'strategic value' when evaluating potential R&D investments, especially when comparing a low-risk, incremental improvement in a mature market versus a high-risk, potentially disruptive first-in-class asset?",

Clinical Differentiation measures the asset's ability to achieve a meaningful improvement over the standard of care—for example, assessing if a first-in-class asset offers a 30% durable response rate advantage versus the 10% seen with current therapies, rather than just a marginal 5% gain. Market Access Potential considers the regulatory pathway and commercial viability, prioritizing assets with the potential for accelerated approval or breakthrough designation, as I achieved with the fast-track designation for our novel PD-L1 inhibitor at BioGen Innovations. Finally, Pipeline Optionality assesses how the investment generates future opportunities, such as platform technologies or modular assets that can be rapidly repurposed for new indications, thereby de-risking the overall portfolio and maximizing long-term shareholder value.",

Using your framework, how do you explicitly compare and weigh a low-risk, incremental asset (e.g., a next-generation formulation) against a high-risk, potentially disruptive asset (e.g., a novel gene therapy platform), and specifically, how does the 'Portfolio Resilience' pillar help you assign differential weighting to these two vastly different investment profiles?",

My framework addresses this through a structured, two-phase evaluation process. First, the 'Scientific Merit' pillar assigns a probability of technical success (PTS) and potential market size for both assets; the low-risk formulation might have a 90% PTS but a limited market, while the novel gene therapy might have a 20% PTS but a transformative market. Second, the 'Portfolio Resilience' pillar assigns differential weighting based on strategic fit and contingency planning. For the high-risk asset, resilience mandates lower initial resource commitment but higher strategic prioritization, ensuring we have defined go/no-go decision points and pre-identified mitigation strategies, such as parallel development of alternative delivery vectors. For example, when we pursued the high-risk, first-in-class CAR-T asset at BioGen, we deliberately weighted its success lower in short-term financial projections but assigned it maximum strategic weight, securing dedicated, ring-fenced funding that would not impact the progression of our established small-molecule pipeline, thereby protecting overall portfolio stability.",

I realized my greatest satisfaction came not just from *telling* the story of the product, but from the initial steps of identifying the market need and defining the solution itself; for example, during a campaign for a B2B client, our market research revealed that users were abandoning the onboarding flow due to a poorly integrated feature, and while I could market around it, I couldn't directly prioritize the engineering fix, which is the kind of strategic decision-making I am eager to own as a Junior PM.

Then, I would create a concise Product Requirements Document (PRD) focusing heavily on the user story and the business impact, ensuring the engineering team understands that this isn't just a design tweak but a critical revenue recovery initiative, and we'd measure success strictly via A/B testing the old vs. new flow's conversion rate over a two-week period.",

How do you ensure your product aligns with Shopify's overall mission?\n\nFor **Stakeholder Management**, think about *who* you need to influence beyond engineering (e.g., Marketing, Sales, Legal, Leadership).

For example, when launching the new B2B content hub for our largest SaaS client, the sales team insisted on integrating a specific, highly technical feature immediately, but market research showed users were struggling with basic navigation, so I had to synthesize that data and present a phased roadmap to both teams, successfully negotiating a delay on the technical feature in favor of immediate UX improvements which ultimately reduced the bounce rate by 18% in the first month. This experience taught me that effective stakeholder management isn't just about saying yes or no, but about translating competing priorities into a unified, data-backed product narrative that everyone can buy into.",

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nI have to say, your background is incredibly impressive. 22 years as a Chief Operating Officer gives you a unique perspective on scaling operations, driving efficiency, and managing complexity—all things that are absolutely critical to Amazon. We’re excited to dive into how your executive experience aligns with the strategic challenges we face here.\n\nOur conversation today will focus on how you approach large-scale process transformation, how you lead change across diverse teams, and how you translate strategic vision into measurable operational improvements.\n\nBefore we jump in, do you have any initial questions for me about the role or the team?\"\n\n*(Wait for a brief response, then transition smoothly.)*\n\n\"Great. Let’s start.\"\n\n---\n\n### First Interview Question (Focusing on Executive-Level Strategy & Scale)\n\nThis question is designed to immediately tap into their executive experience (COO) and align it with Amazon's core focus on measurable, large-scale operational transformation.\n\n**\"Given your extensive experience as a COO, you’ve undoubtedly been responsible for setting and executing high-level strategic goals. Here at Amazon, Operations Excellence isn't just about incremental improvement; it's about step-function change at massive scale.**\n\n**Can you walk me through a time when you identified a systemic operational bottleneck or inefficiency that was significantly impacting the company's P&L or customer experience? More importantly, how did you structure the transformation initiative—from securing executive buy-in and defining the metrics, to ensuring the solution was successfully implemented and sustained across multiple business units?\"**",
