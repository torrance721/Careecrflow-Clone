Let's set the stage.\n\n---\n\n## Mock Interview Start\n\n### Opening (Warm and Professional)\n\n\"Hi [Candidate Name], thanks so much for taking the time to speak with us today. I’m [Your Name], and I lead the investment team focused on our Series B portfolio. We’ve been really impressed with your background—seven years in M&A gives you a fantastic foundation in rigorous financial analysis and transaction execution, which is crucial for the diligence we perform here.\"\n\n\"At [Firm Name], we are passionate about helping companies scale from strong traction to market leaders, and we are constantly looking for Associates who can blend financial discipline with strategic vision.\"\n\n\"We want this conversation to be a true dialogue, so please feel free to ask me questions throughout. How are you doing today, and are you ready to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n### First Interview Question (Bridging M&A to VC)\n\n\"That’s great. Let’s start with a foundational question that helps us understand how you view the transition from your previous work to venture capital.\"\n\n\"In M&A, you are primarily focused on valuing established cash flows, realizing synergies, and assessing risk through the lens of a control premium. In Series B venture capital, we are valuing high-growth companies that are often prioritizing market share and scaling efficiency over immediate profitability.\"\n\n**\"Given your strong M&A background, how do you adjust your valuation framework and diligence process to effectively evaluate a Series B company that is burning cash but showing exceptional growth in a massive, yet unproven, market?\"**",

      "content": "That is an excellent question, and it gets right to the heart of the transition. While the core discipline of financial modeling remains essential, the shift from control-premium valuation to growth-potential assessment requires a fundamental pivot in focus—moving from historical cash flow stability to forward-looking market dynamics and operational efficiency. Specifically, I would de-emphasize the traditional DCF model, which relies too heavily on distant terminal values and established margins, and instead prioritize market-based approaches like the Venture Capital Method and comparable transaction analysis, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) like customer lifetime value (LTV), customer acquisition cost (CAC), and net retention rates, which are far more indicative of scale potential than current EBITDA. For example, during my time at Global Investment Bank, I advised a private equity client on a carve-out where the target was pre-profitability but dominated a niche SaaS market; we successfully applied a forward revenue multiple based on projected 3-year recurring revenue, adjusted for churn risk, which is a methodology directly transferable to Series B diligence. The diligence process itself shifts from scrutinizing balance sheet liabilities to rigorously stress-testing unit economics and the scalability of the go-to-market strategy, ensuring the company can actually achieve the projected market penetration that justifies the high valuation multiple.",

      "content": "That is an excellent question, and it speaks directly to the shift in perspective required when moving from mature M&A transactions to high-growth venture investing. While my background is rooted in rigorous financial modeling—developing complex DCF and LBO models for multi-billion dollar deals—the process for evaluating a $5M ARR SaaS company pivots entirely from enterprise value to growth potential and moat construction. My initial process involves a deep dive into the unit economics, specifically focusing on the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) payback period and the Lifetime Value (LTV) to CAC ratio, aiming for a ratio exceeding 3x, which signals sustainable scalability rather than just brute-force growth. Crucially, beyond these metrics, I prioritize analyzing the *defensibility* through two key lenses: Gross Retention Rate, which must be pristine (ideally 90%+), and the Net Dollar Retention (NDR), as NDR consistently above 120% indicates the product is truly mission-critical and expanding within its existing customer base, proving inherent scalability without constant reliance on new logo acquisition. For instance, in my M&A role, when we assessed a carve-out of a healthcare IT platform, we recognized that the true value was not in the immediate EBITDA, but in the sticky integration—a high switching cost that ensured retention, a principle I now apply to assessing product-market fit and scalability in early-stage SaaS.",

To take that concept further, how would you move beyond the qualitative description and *quantify* those switching costs if you were diligencing a $5M ARR B2B SaaS company? What specific data points or metrics would you demand from the management team to truly prove the stickiness of their product?",

      "content": "That is an excellent question that gets right to the core of evaluating durable competitive advantages in B2B SaaS, especially at that $5 million ARR stage where retention is paramount. To move beyond the qualitative, we must demand data that directly correlates to the friction of departure, focusing on three key quantitative areas: integration depth, usage patterns, and migration costs. Specifically, I would require the average number of active integrations per customer—for example, connections to their ERP or CRM systems—as a high count suggests deep embedding and high technical switching costs. Secondly, we need granular usage metrics, such as the percentage of core features utilized or the average number of unique users per client seat, as low feature adoption implies low reliance. Finally, and most critically, I would demand detailed churn analysis segmented by the time-to-churn, looking specifically for the \"time-to-value\" metric; if a customer churns after 18 months versus 3 months, the implied switching cost is significantly higher. During a recent diligence project involving an HR Tech platform, we found that customers using the API integration suite had a net retention rate 30 points higher than those using only the basic UI, which definitively quantified the value of that specific integration-based stickiness.",

Building on that foundation, let's pivot slightly to market dynamics: at Series B, how do you assess the defensibility of a company's market position, specifically when they are operating in a crowded or rapidly consolidating space, and can you give an example of a market where you would still recommend an investment despite significant existing competition?",

      "content": "That is an excellent and highly relevant question, particularly in the current climate where true blue oceans are rare. Assessing defensibility in a crowded Series B environment requires moving beyond simple market share metrics and focusing intensely on proprietary advantages and switching costs. Specifically, I look for three key pillars: high intellectual property moats—patents or unique data sets that competitors cannot easily replicate—deep integration into the customer workflow that makes extraction painful, and evidence of network effects that scale rapidly, making the incumbent solution exponentially more valuable as more users join. A perfect example of a crowded market where I would still recommend investment is the B2B vertical SaaS space for specialized industries, such as construction project management software. While there are established players, during my time at the bank, we advised on the acquisition of a niche provider whose product was deeply embedded into the regulatory compliance framework of its specific state, creating an impenetrable barrier for national competitors who lacked that localized data and integration. This regulatory lock-in, despite the market being saturated overall, demonstrated a clear, defensible wedge that justified a premium valuation and strong future growth prospects.",

Building on that, we need to shift gears slightly and talk about the 'people' element, which is critical at Series B. We often see founders who excel at the initial product-market fit struggle with the organizational complexity of scaling; what are the three most critical attributes you look for in a founding team specifically when they are transitioning from the startup phase (Series A) to the scale-up phase (Series B and beyond)?",

Based on my experience evaluating management teams during extensive M&A due diligence, the three most critical attributes for a founding team moving into Series B are, first, **Humility and Coachability**, second, **A Demonstrated Ability to Delegate and Attract Tier-1 Talent**, and third, **Strategic Foresight Beyond the Next Quarter.**\n\nTo elaborate on the second point, the ability to delegate is paramount; a founder who insists on being the bottleneck for every operational decision will crush growth. We look for evidence that they have already successfully hired key executive roles—a strong COO or Head of Sales—who are empowered to execute. For example, during a recent acquisition assessment in the health-tech space, we discounted the valuation of a target company by nearly 15% because the CEO, while brilliant technically, had driven out three consecutive sales VPs due to micromanagement, indicating a fundamental inability to trust and scale the leadership structure required for a successful integration, let alone organic growth. Finally, strategic foresight means they are already thinking about the necessary organizational structure, potential regulatory hurdles, and future capital needs two years out, not just the features they are shipping next month.",

As we start to wrap up, I have one final, more strategic question that will bring everything together: We've covered a lot of ground today—from competitive moats in B2B SaaS and Series B market defensibility to evaluating founder scaling capabilities. To wrap up, imagine you successfully sourced and led a Series B investment into a company that is now a clear outlier in our portfolio. What is the single, non-obvious factor you believe was most critical to that company's success, and how did you identify it during your initial diligence?",

While everyone focuses on TAM, unit economics, and product-market fit, the single, non-obvious factor I would prioritize is the *founder's capacity for structured self-doubt and rapid iteration based on negative signals*. During diligence, we often look for conviction, but true success hinges on the humility to pivot quickly when the market proves the initial hypothesis wrong. I would identify this by analyzing their historical response to setbacks—for example, looking beyond the pitch deck and examining the raw data from their first significant customer churn event or a failed product launch, specifically noting the speed and decisiveness with which they overhauled their strategy. In my M&A experience, I saw a $500 million healthcare tech deal almost collapse because the target CEO refused to acknowledge declining utilization rates in a key geography; the successful companies, conversely, had leaders who actively sought out and internalized critical feedback, treating negative data not as a failure, but as the most valuable input for future growth modeling. This willingness to kill a darling feature or abandon a successful but ultimately limiting distribution channel is the ultimate predictor of long-term scaling capability, far beyond mere financial projections.",
