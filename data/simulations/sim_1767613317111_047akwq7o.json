Resume: Executive leader with 14 years of progressive experience managing complex, multi-billion dollar global supply chains in the manufacturing and logistics sectors. Currently serving as VP of Global Suppl... Situation: I have hit the ceiling at OmniCorp; the company culture is resistant to the radical, fast-paced changes I believe are necessary for future growth. I am ready for a high-stakes, high-impact role where operational efficiency and speed are paramount, even if it means navigating a more volatile environment.",

Welcome! I'm Alex Chen, and I lead our Global Supply Chain Strategy team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today. We’re incredibly excited about this role, given how critical battery supply is to Tesla's mission and growth trajectory.\n\nWe've been very impressed with your extensive background, especially your 14 years as VP of Global Supply Chain Operations. Your experience managing complex, global logistics at scale is exactly what we need.\n\nToday, I want to learn more about how you think strategically, how you execute operationally, and how you lead teams through rapid change. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have along the way.\n\nReady to jump in?\"\n\n***\n\n## First Interview Question\n\n\"Excellent. To start, let's focus on the strategic landscape.\n\nThe Director of Battery Supply Chain at Tesla operates at the intersection of extreme scaling, geopolitical volatility, and intense cost pressure. We aren't just managing existing contracts; we are building the future supply chain from the ground up—from mining to cell production to recycling.\n\nGiven your background in managing complex global operations, **how would you approach prioritizing the three most significant risks facing Tesla's battery supply chain today, and what immediate strategic initiative would you launch to mitigate the highest-priority risk?**\"",

      "content": "The three most significant risks are raw material scarcity, geopolitical trade instability, and manufacturing yield variability during scaling. Raw material scarcity, specifically lithium and nickel, is the highest priority risk due to long lead times and finite near-term availability. My immediate strategic initiative would be launching a multi-continent, direct-to-mine equity partnership program, mirroring the risk mitigation strategy I used at OmniCorp to secure critical rare-earth metals during the 2018 trade disputes, ensuring guaranteed supply floors and cost stability.",

Let's deep-dive into the execution for Tesla: given their scale and need for massive, reliable supply, how would you structure a direct-to-mine equity partnership program, specifically detailing the criteria you'd use to select partners and how you would mitigate the significant financial and geological risks inherent in taking upstream equity stakes?",

      "content": "Structuring a direct-to-mine equity program requires stringent due diligence focused on resource viability and governance. Partner selection must prioritize proven reserves (P50 minimum), jurisdictional stability, and ESG compliance, not just immediate cost savings. We mitigate financial and geological risks through phased investment linked to operational milestones, similar to how I structured our $400M long-term logistics capacity contracts at OmniCorp, which included performance-based exit clauses. This approach ensures capital is deployed only as extraction certainty increases, securing critical materials while managing exposure.",

      "content": "That's a helpful overview of the phased investment structure, particularly the milestone-based approach. However, mining equity stakes carry unique risks compared to logistics contracts, so let's delve deeper into the protective mechanisms. Specifically, how would you structure the exit clauses and clawbacks in a direct-to-mine equity agreement to protect Tesla's capital and ensure supply priority if the project significantly underperforms, or if the resource proves unviable after the initial investment phase?",

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Exit clauses must be structured around performance metrics, not just time. We would implement a tiered clawback tied to proven reserves and production milestones, ensuring capital recovery if the project fails to meet 80% of the projected yield within the first 36 months. For example, during the renegotiation of our European rail contracts, we structured a similar clause allowing us to divest 50% of our committed volume without penalty if on-time performance dropped below 95% for two consecutive quarters. This transfers the performance risk directly to the partner.",

      "content": "That framework for handling performance-based operational failures is certainly robust. However, the unique risk in mining equity is resource unviability—the lithium simply isn't there, or is uneconomical to extract, which is distinct from a manufacturing yield issue. How would you structure the due diligence and contractual agreements to specifically mitigate the risk of geological failure or resource downgrade *before* significant capital expenditure, ensuring Tesla is protected against resource unviability itself?",

      "content": "Mitigating geological failure requires layered due diligence and contractual triggers. We would structure due diligence around independent, third-party geological surveys and mandatory pre-feasibility studies (PFS) with defined minimum resource viability thresholds tied directly to the contract's go/no-go clause. Contractually, we would utilize staged capital release contingent upon hitting specific extraction milestones and include a clawback provision based on resource downgrade below the PFS baseline. At OmniCorp, we applied similar mechanisms to secure rare earth mineral contracts, ensuring initial capital investment was less than 5% until the second-stage resource verification was complete.",
