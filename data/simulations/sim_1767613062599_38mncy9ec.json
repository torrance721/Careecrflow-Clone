Welcome! I’m [Your Name], and I lead the Operations Excellence team for [Specify the Amazon division, e.g., Global Fulfillment, AWS Infrastructure, etc.]. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today.\n\nI have to say, your background is incredibly impressive. 22 years as a Chief Operating Officer gives you a unique perspective on scaling operations, driving efficiency, and managing complexity—all things that are absolutely critical to Amazon. We’re excited to dive into how your executive experience aligns with the strategic challenges we face here.\n\nOur conversation today will focus on how you approach large-scale process transformation, how you lead change across diverse teams, and how you translate strategic vision into measurable operational improvements.\n\nBefore we jump in, do you have any initial questions for me about the role or the team?\"\n\n*(Wait for a brief response, then transition smoothly.)*\n\n\"Great. Let’s start.\"\n\n---\n\n### First Interview Question (Focusing on Executive-Level Strategy & Scale)\n\nThis question is designed to immediately tap into their executive experience (COO) and align it with Amazon's core focus on measurable, large-scale operational transformation.\n\n**\"Given your extensive experience as a COO, you’ve undoubtedly been responsible for setting and executing high-level strategic goals. Here at Amazon, Operations Excellence isn't just about incremental improvement; it's about step-function change at massive scale.**\n\n**Can you walk me through a time when you identified a systemic operational bottleneck or inefficiency that was significantly impacting the company's P&L or customer experience? More importantly, how did you structure the transformation initiative—from securing executive buy-in and defining the metrics, to ensuring the solution was successfully implemented and sustained across multiple business units?\"**",

To better understand the scope of the VP role you held, I'd like to pivot now to the execution: That $200 million loss and 18% error rate transformation is incredibly compelling.

Specifically, what was your strategy for securing executive and board buy-in, and how did you structure the implementation and change management across multiple business units to ensure adoption and sustainment of the new system?",
