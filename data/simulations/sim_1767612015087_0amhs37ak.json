I’m [Your Name], and I’m really excited to chat with you today.\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to speak with us about the Associate Brand Manager role here at Nike. We know you’ve been doing some great work as a Marketing Coordinator for the past few years, and we're eager to learn how your experience aligns with our brand strategy.\n\nBefore we dive into the specifics of the role, I’d love to start with a question that helps us understand your perspective on brand management and growth.\n\n***\n\n### First Interview Question\n\n**\"Given your experience in coordinating marketing efforts, we’re curious about your vision for stepping into a more strategic role.**\n\n**Imagine you are responsible for a key Nike product line (e.g., running shoes or lifestyle apparel). How do you define 'brand success' for that line, and what is the very first strategic initiative you would launch in the next 90 days to drive both cultural relevance and commercial growth?\"**",

      "content": "That’s a great question. For a Nike product line, I define brand success as achieving high cultural relevance—measured by organic social mentions and earned media—which then translates directly into commercial growth, specifically a 10% year-over-year increase in direct-to-consumer sales. My first 90-day initiative would be an intensive content audit and pivot toward user-generated content (UGC) campaigns across platforms, focusing on authenticity. At Local Brew Co., shifting our focus to UGC featuring local athletes increased our online engagement by 35%, proving the power of community-driven relevance to boost sales.",

You mentioned pivoting toward a User-Generated Content strategy, citing your experience at Local Brew Co. Nike operates at a massive, global scale, so how would you adapt a successful UGC campaign from a local or regional brand to effectively drive both cultural relevance and 10% DTC growth for a major Nike product line, like the Air Max, within that 90-day window?",

A strong approach might be to structure your answer around three critical areas: 1) **Scaling and Moderation** (how do you manage global submissions?), 2) **Incentivization and Reach** (what motivates millions of users?), and 3) **Localization vs. Universality** (how do you ensure cultural relevance in different markets while maintaining a unified brand message?)."

At Local Brew Co., we ran the \"Weekend Pour\" UGC campaign, which generated a 35% engagement increase by focusing on *where* people enjoyed the product, not just the product itself. For Air Max, I would adapt this by launching a highly-curated, geographically-segmented campaign like \"Air Max: City Strides,\" providing distinct visual prompts and localized hashtags for major global markets (e.g., Tokyo, London, NYC). This approach drives cultural relevance by celebrating local style while maintaining a unified, high-quality visual standard, which is essential for a premium brand like Nike to achieve that 10% DTC growth.",

To really understand the operational feasibility, let's dive into the execution: could you walk me through the specific execution plan, detailing how you would allocate a hypothetical $500,000 marketing budget across platforms (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, Nike App) to drive the UGC, and what is the direct mechanism connecting participation in the campaign to the targeted 10% DTC sales growth within that 90-day window?",

        "hintContent": "You've established a great strategy with 'Air Max: City Strides.' Now, let's focus on the two critical components of execution: the budget and the conversion mechanism. For the budget, try using a simple 50/30/20 split (or similar) to allocate the $500k across the three platforms (e.g., TikTok for reach, Instagram for visual quality, Nike App for conversion). For the conversion mechanism, focus on the direct incentive—what specific action (e.g., a unique code, a discount, early access) is given to the participant *on the Nike App* that immediately drives them toward completing a DTC purchase?"

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "That's a strong challenge. For the 'City Strides' execution, I would allocate 60% of the $500k budget to performance marketing on Instagram and TikTok, focusing on video ads driving traffic to a dedicated Nike App landing page that hosts the UGC submission tool. The remaining 40% would fund localized micro-influencer partnerships and geo-targeted event boosts, similar to how I used a $15k budget at Local Brew Co. to drive 200+ submissions for our \"Brew Your Best Life\" photo contest. The direct mechanism for the 10% DTC growth is a tiered incentive: participants who submit UGC receive a unique, time-sensitive 15% discount code for the featured Air Max line, creating immediate purchase urgency tied directly to campaign participation.",

I believe I can immediately apply this optimization mindset to Nike's digital channels, ensuring that every touchpoint, especially around the Air Max line, is maximizing its impact and driving measurable results.",
