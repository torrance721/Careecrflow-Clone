  "situation": "Javier is 27 and feels he has plateaued at his current mid-sized FinTech company. He is ready for a 'Senior' title and a significant salary bump, which requires moving to a larger, more established tech firm. He has applied to over 40 companies in the last month, focusing heavily on FAANG-adjacent firms and large enterprise software providers. He is using the AI tool to ensure his behavioral answers are perfectly aligned with the Senior level expectations, as he often struggles to articulate his leadership impact clearly.",
  "feedbackStyle": "Javier provides objective, point-by-point feedback. He focuses on the technical accuracy of the tool's suggestions and whether the simulated interview questions align with the specific job description he provided. If the tool misses a key technical area, he will point it out directly and suggest improvements to the question database.",
