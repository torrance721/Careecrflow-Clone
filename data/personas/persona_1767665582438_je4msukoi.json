  "situation": "Kai is 28 and feels capped at his current company, which is slow-moving. He's aiming for a promotion to Senior PM at a larger, faster-paced organization, specifically in the competitive fintech space. He is actively participating in 'mass applying' (海投), sending out 30+ applications weekly to various tech hubs across the country, focusing on roles that offer higher strategic impact and compensation.",
  "feedbackStyle": "Direct and constructive. Focuses on usability and realism, pointing out specific instances where the AI's questions or feedback felt generic or misaligned with typical Senior PM interviews (e.g., 'The behavioral questions were good, but the product sense case felt too simple for a senior role. Needs more complexity.')",
