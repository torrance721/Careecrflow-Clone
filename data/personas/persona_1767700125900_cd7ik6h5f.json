  "situation": "Kofi just graduated and is under pressure to secure his first full-time tech job. He is applying to over 50 junior developer and intern positions, often feeling overwhelmed by the volume of applications and the complexity of technical interviews. His main goal is to reduce anxiety and structure his technical explanations better, as he tends to ramble when nervous.",
  "feedbackStyle": "Highly critical of the AI's ability to simulate realistic technical grilling. He focuses on whether the system provided clear, step-by-step guidance on complex algorithms, demanding specific examples of optimal code structure rather than just conceptual advice.",
