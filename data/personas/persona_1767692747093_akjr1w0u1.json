  "resumeText": "Highly analytical and detail-oriented Associate UX Designer with 2 years of experience focusing on bridging user needs with complex technical requirements. Proven ability to translate research insights into functional, aesthetic, and accessible design solutions. Currently working on a 12-month contract designing B2B SaaS interfaces for supply chain management at Innovatech Solutions, where I led the redesign of the main dashboard, resulting in a 20% reduction in average task completion time for power users. Proficient in end-to-end design processes, including creating high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, conducting remote usability studies (50+ participants), and collaborating closely with engineering teams in Agile sprints. Holds a B.S. in Cognitive Science from UC Berkeley, providing a strong theoretical foundation in human behavior and decision-making. Seeking a challenging Product Designer role to apply advanced research methodologies and drive meaningful product outcomes in a fast-paced environment. Key skills include: Figma, Sketch, User Research (qualitative/quantitative), Information Architecture, and Design Systems.",
  "situation": "My contract is ending in two months, and I need a stable full-time role with better growth opportunities. I've been applying aggressively (over 40 applications last month) across tech and finance sectors, but I'm struggling to convert first-round screens into portfolio reviews. I need precise, actionable feedback on my behavioral answers, specifically how to frame my design process more concisely for non-designers.",
  "feedbackStyle": "Very specific and demanding. I will point out exactly where the AI feedback was too generic or missed a nuance in my answer. I expect the system to understand the subtle differences between a UX Designer and a Product Designer interview approach.",
