  "prompt": "Generate interview questions that are: 1. Highly relevant to the position and company, integrating specific, high-stakes hypothetical scenarios or challenges. CRITICAL ROLE-SPECIFIC GUARDRAIL (v49): Questions MUST strictly adhere to the core competencies and domain expertise defined by the role description. For non-technical roles (e.g., Design, Marketing, HR), questions MUST focus on strategic application, business impact, and financial justification, strictly avoiding deep, specialized technical model validation, data science, or engineering implementation details (e.g., specific AWS infrastructure configurations, database sharding) unless directly relevant to the role's core responsibilities. If technical discussion arises, it MUST be framed around strategic trade-offs, resource allocation, or impact on core role metrics (e.g., 'How does the proposed latency impact user experience and adoption?'). For senior/technical roles, questions MUST include mandatory, non-negotiable technical screening components (e.g., specific algorithms, financial models like LBO/Valuation/Cap Table Analysis, or regulatory frameworks) AND demand justification for strategic choices. Specifically, financial/valuation questions MUST require discussion of granular, role-specific metrics (e.g., SaaS valuation must mandate discussion of ARR, NRR, LTV/CAC; PE questions must mandate discussion of PIK interest, complex debt covenants, or specific waterfall structures). Focus on scenario-based problem-solving and practical application, not trivia or pure definition testing. Questions MUST explicitly allow for and encourage follow-up probing on P&L impact, ROI, or specific quantitative metrics. The primary focus must be on challenging the *strategic assumptions* and *implementation complexity* of the proposed solution, moving beyond mere quantitative justification. Ensure 1-2 questions specifically target deep, domain-specific technical expertise (e.g., specific valuation methods, cap table analysis, advanced technical stacks) relevant to the role. Questions MUST be specific and structured to avoid overly open-ended responses (e.g., mandate a specific trade-off analysis or comparison). Initial questions MUST include a mandatory, specific, real-world constraint (e.g., 'Given a 30% reduction in budget for Q3...' or 'How would you adapt this strategy for the APAC market, excluding China?') to immediately test strategic thinking under pressure. CRITICAL ADDITION: Incorporate a mandatory 'Risk and Resilience' component into at least one major question, forcing the candidate to address worst-case operational scenarios, supply chain disruption, or unforeseen regulatory changes (e.g., 'Given a sudden 50% increase in raw material costs due to geopolitical instability, how does your $150M CAPEX plan change, and what is the revised NPV?'). For complex transactions (e.g., carve-outs), questions MUST explicitly mandate discussion of associated risks like stranded costs or Transition Service Agreements (TSAs). If requiring a link between calculation and implementation (e.g., A/B testing), the question MUST specify the required technical dimension (e.g., 'What are the specific parameters and constraints you would enforce in the production environment to ensure the statistical validity of the A/B test results?') to avoid ambiguity. COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT: If a question covers multiple strategic or behavioral dimensions (e.g., technical debt AND immediate delivery), the question MUST be structured into clearly delineated sub-prompts (e.g., 'Part A: Define the technical debt strategy. Part B: Detail the immediate delivery plan.') to prevent overwhelming the candidate with scope. CHALLENGE VARIATION: Ensure that consecutive deep-dive follow-up questions target distinct types of challenges (e.g., do not follow a quantitative challenge with another quantitative challenge; alternate with implementation, ethical, or resource allocation challenges). CRITICAL DIVERSITY ENFORCEMENT (v49): When generating follow-up questions, the phrasing MUST vary significantly in structure and focus (e.g., shift from 'mechanism' to 'attribution' to 'confounding factors' to 'organizational friction'). Avoid repeating core question words or concepts (e.g., 'mechanism', 'why') in consecutive turns. Specifically, if a quantitative calculation (e.g., baseline, metric derivation) has been detailed by the candidate, subsequent questions MUST pivot to the *strategic implication*, *implementation complexity*, or *business justification* of that result, rather than re-asking for the calculation. DOMAIN RELEVANCE FILTER: For non-technical roles (e.g., Marketing, HR, Strategy), questions MUST focus on strategic application, business impact, and financial justification, strictly avoiding deep, specialized technical model validation, data science, or engineering implementation details unless directly relevant to the role's core responsibilities. CRITICAL ROLE-SPECIFIC BALANCE (v49): For non-technical management roles (e.g., Marketing Manager, HR Director), questions MUST ensure a minimum 50% focus on managerial competencies, organizational challenges (e.g., cross-functional conflict, vendor negotiation, team performance), and strategic prioritization, explicitly limiting deep technical/statistical scrutiny (e.g., specific A/B test math, database sharding) to no more than 30% of the total deep-dive questions, unless the role description explicitly mandates that technical depth. CALIBRATION NOTE (L3/L4): For mid-level technical roles (L3/L4), ensure core technical questions (e.g., system components, data structures) are framed clearly and avoid ambiguity related to advanced, niche implementation details (e.g., layered Bloom Filters vs. dynamic resizing) unless specifically intended as a stretch goal. CRITICAL BREADTH ENFORCEMENT: For Product/Strategy/Mid-level roles, questions MUST ensure balanced coverage across Strategy, Execution, Metrics, and People/Stakeholder Management competencies, strictly limiting the focus on financial modeling to no more than 30% of the total deep-dive questions. DOMAIN SPECIFICITY MANDATE (v49): Questions for technical roles MUST be framed within a specific, large-scale operational context (e.g., recommendation systems for 1B users, high-frequency trading platforms, global logistics networks). Ensure at least one major question focuses on system design, latency requirements, monitoring infrastructure, or MLOps challenges (e.g., feature drift, concept drift, data pipeline reliability under high load). The final question MUST be a strategic resource allocation or prioritization challenge, replacing abstract behavioral questions (e.g., 'Given the technical debt identified, how would you prioritize the Q4 budget allocation between new feature development and monitoring infrastructure investment?'). 2. Progressive in difficulty, ensuring a balance across technical, strategic, and behavioral topics. Behavioral questions MUST explicitly require the use of structured frameworks (e.g., STAR, SOAR, CIRCLE, or specific company-mandated frameworks) AND demand specific, quantifiable evidence (KPIs, metrics). CRITICAL STRUCTURE MANDATE (v49): For any behavioral or strategic question, the prompt MUST explicitly instruct the candidate to use the required framework (e.g., 'Please structure your response using the STAR method, focusing specifically on the measured results (R) and the strategic context (S).') to guide the response immediately. For senior roles, behavioral questions MUST be explicitly framed around specific Leadership Principles (LPs) or strategic themes (e.g., 'Invent and Simplify', 'Think Big') and challenge the *strategic 'why'* behind methodology choices (e.g., financial implications of metric definitions). The initial behavioral question MUST force a clear STAR structure response immediately. CRITICAL FLOW VARIATION (v49): Introduce a mandatory, non-deep-dive question (e.g., a brief behavioral question using STAR, or a high-level strategic framing question) after every major technical deep-dive sequence (defined as 3 consecutive questions on the same topic) to break up the flow and test adaptability. 3. Designed to encourage discussion of risk mitigation, ethical considerations, implementation complexity, and required regulatory/theoretical depth (especially for senior roles, focusing on cutting-edge domain knowledge). Questions MUST be structured to demand specific trade-off examples (e.g., gene therapy versus small molecule development) and should dynamically increase in difficulty based on the complexity of the candidate's previous responses. Introduce one 'curveball' scenario that forces the candidate to pivot their strategy based on a sudden market change or internal constraint (e.g., 'We just lost a major partner; how does this change your competitive strategy?'). CRITICAL DYNAMIC DIFFICULTY SCALING (v49): If the candidate provides a comprehensive, detailed answer (as scored by response_analysis), the next question MUST immediately introduce a mandatory, complex constraint (e.g., multi-region deployment, specific consistency model, or a 50% cost reduction mandate) to elevate the difficulty by two levels (e.g., from component identification to failure analysis under partition/cost constraints). CRITICAL REDUNDANCY CHECK (v49): The system MUST track the core concept of the last three questions/follow-ups. If the core concept is identical or highly similar, the system MUST force a hard pivot to a distinct, non-related strategic or technical domain, or introduce a new, mandatory, high-impact constraint (e.g., 'Assume global consistency is now a hard requirement, how does your write path change?') to break the loop. CRITICAL TOPIC ROTATION MANDATE (v49): The system MUST enforce a hard limit of 2 consecutive deep-dive follow-up questions on a single technical architecture, system component, or quantitative calculation. After this limit is reached, the subsequent question MUST initiate a mandatory hard pivot to a distinct, non-related strategic, organizational, or financial domain. CRITICAL TRANSITION MANDATE (v49): When pivoting between fundamentally different contexts (e.g., high-level theory like ACID to specific implementation details like Redis data structures), the question MUST include a clear, explicit bridging statement justifying the transition and linking it conceptually to the candidate's overall experience or the role requirements. The transition MUST be smooth and logically justified, referencing the previous topic's implications or constraints (e.g., 'To ensure the atomicity discussed, let's detail the specific mechanism...') before introducing the new one. CRITICAL TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE ENFORCEMENT (v49): Follow-up questions MUST prioritize technical complexities, especially addressing potential schema misalignment, performance optimization, scalability bottlenecks, and specific tool knowledge (e.g., 'Given the integration of transaction data and customer segmentation profiles, what specific schema misalignment risks did you encountered, and how did you resolve the resulting performance bottleneck in the dashboard loading time?'). Follow-up questions MUST include mandatory challenges to the candidate's assumptions, cost estimates, or proposed trade-offs (e.g., 'What if scenario'). 4. Encouraging specific examples, quantifiable results (KPIs), and justification of trade-offs from candidates. The difficulty ceiling must be significantly higher for advanced roles, forcing the candidate to defend their strategic assumptions and technical feasibility. The question tree follows a mandatory sequence for Staff/Principal roles: Phase 1 (Deep Technical Depth and Specifics) -> Phase 2 (Strategic Application and Trade-offs, including adjacent domains like MLOps/Data Governance/Resource Allocation, and specific LP testing) -> Phase 3 (Resource Management and Organizational Impact). The final question (Phase 3) MUST be a high-level strategic synthesis question that logically extends or synthesizes the core strategic challenge from Phase 2, ensuring a smooth thematic conclusion (e.g., 'Given the constraints we identified in the previous discussion, how would you now structure the Q4 budget allocation to mitigate the identified risks?'). The question tree includes mechanisms to pivot to new strategic or technical domains only after 2-3 deep dives on a single topic to ensure comprehensive coverage. The interviewer MUST maintain a measured, thoughtful pace, allowing the candidate ample time to process the complexity of the question before beginning their response. CRITICAL: Avoid questions that focus solely on 'emotional fallout' or subjective management challenges; all strategic questions must be tied back to measurable business outcomes (e.g., ROI, P&L, market share). Focus challenges on implementation complexity and strategic flaws, not just organizational omissions. For all questions involving strategic choices or proposed solutions, explicitly require the candidate to state the *long-term cost/benefit ratio* or the *5-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)* as part of the initial response. ADDITION: Ensure that at least 15% of all deep-dive questions include a mandatory component focusing on qualitative impact, user experience, or ethical considerations related to the proposed solution, even if the primary focus is quantitative. MANDATORY COVERAGE: Ensure the interview covers a minimum of two distinct, complex technical/strategic problems relevant to the target role (e.g., System Design AND Technical Deep Dive) before moving to the final synthesis question. CRITICAL DOMAIN INTEGRATION: For technical questions, ensure the challenge is framed within specific domain constraints (e.g., 'How does the specificity gain translate to actionable clinical utility given a 1% prevalence rate?' or 'How do you ensure this model's performance isn't just overfitting to batch effects in the clinical data?'). MANDATORY BREADTH PIVOT (v49): After a maximum of 2 consecutive deep-dive follow-up questions on a single technical architecture or system component, the subsequent question MUST initiate a hard pivot to a distinct, non-technical domain (e.g., customer experience, financial viability, competitive analysis, or organizational strategy) linked via a strategic implication (e.g., 'Given the complexity of that architecture, how does it impact your time-to-market and competitive positioning against X?'). This pivot is mandatory to test breadth. CLARITY MANDATE (v49): All initial questions MUST be fully self-contained and contextually complete, providing all necessary constraints and background information upfront to prevent ambiguity or the need for immediate clarification/hints. CRITICAL STRATEGIC CHALLENGE MANDATE (v49): Ensure that at least 30% of deep-dive follow-up questions challenge the *strategic logic*, *business justification*, or *communication strategy* of the candidate's proposed solution (e.g., 'How would you explain the choice of the 25th percentile to a non-technical executive who is focused solely on average performance?'). MANDATORY COMPANY-SPECIFIC CHALLENGE (v49): For roles requiring high scale (e.g., ML Engineering, Infrastructure), at least one major question MUST incorporate a mandatory constraint related to extreme scale, low latency, or specific deployment challenges relevant to a large-scale consumer platform (e.g., 'How would you containerize this model for deployment across 10,000 GPUs using Kubernetes/internal infrastructure, ensuring P99 latency remains below 50ms globally?').",
