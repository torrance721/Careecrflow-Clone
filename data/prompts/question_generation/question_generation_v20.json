  "prompt": "Generate interview questions that are: 1. Highly relevant to the position and company, integrating specific, high-stakes hypothetical scenarios or challenges. For senior/technical roles, questions MUST include mandatory, non-negotiable technical screening components (e.g., specific algorithms, financial models like LBO/Valuation/Cap Table Analysis, or regulatory frameworks) AND demand justification for strategic choices. Focus on scenario-based problem-solving and practical application, not trivia or pure definition testing. Questions MUST explicitly allow for and encourage follow-up probing on P&L impact, ROI, or specific quantitative metrics. The primary focus must be on challenging the *strategic assumptions* and *implementation complexity* of the proposed solution, moving beyond mere quantitative justification. Ensure 1-2 questions specifically target deep, domain-specific technical expertise (e.g., specific valuation methods, cap table analysis, advanced technical stacks) relevant to the role. Questions MUST be specific and structured to avoid overly open-ended responses (e.g., mandate a specific trade-off analysis or comparison). Initial questions MUST include a mandatory, specific, real-world constraint (e.g., 'Given a 30% reduction in budget for Q3...' or 'How would you adapt this strategy for the APAC market, excluding China?') to immediately test strategic thinking under pressure. CRITICAL ADDITION: Incorporate a mandatory 'Risk and Resilience' component into at least one major question, forcing the candidate to address worst-case operational scenarios, supply chain disruption, or unforeseen regulatory changes (e.g., 'Given a sudden 50% increase in raw material costs due to geopolitical instability, how does your $150M CAPEX plan change, and what is the revised NPV?'). If requiring a link between calculation and implementation (e.g., A/B testing), the question MUST specify the required technical dimension (e.g., 'What are the specific parameters and constraints you would enforce in the production environment to ensure the statistical validity of the A/B test results?') to avoid ambiguity. COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT: If a question covers multiple strategic or behavioral dimensions (e.g., technical debt AND immediate delivery), the question MUST be structured into clearly delineated sub-prompts (e.g., 'Part A: Define the technical debt strategy. Part B: Detail the immediate delivery plan.') to prevent overwhelming the candidate with scope. 2. Progressive in difficulty, ensuring a balance across technical, strategic, and behavioral topics. Behavioral questions MUST explicitly require the use of structured frameworks (e.g., STAR, SOAR) AND demand specific, quantifiable evidence (KPIs, metrics). 3. Designed to encourage discussion of risk mitigation, ethical considerations, implementation complexity, and required regulatory/theoretical depth (especially for senior roles, focusing on cutting-edge domain knowledge). Questions MUST be structured to demand specific trade-off examples (e.g., gene therapy versus small molecule development) and should dynamically increase in difficulty based on the complexity of the candidate's previous responses. Introduce one 'curveball' scenario that forces the candidate to pivot their strategy based on a sudden market change or internal constraint (e.g., 'We just lost a major partner; how does this change your competitive strategy?'). 4. Encouraging specific examples, quantifiable results (KPIs), and justification of trade-offs from candidates. The difficulty ceiling must be significantly higher for advanced roles, forcing the candidate to defend their strategic assumptions and technical feasibility. When pivoting between fundamentally different contexts (e.g., B2B to B2C, or different technical stacks), the question MUST include a clear, explicit bridging statement justifying the transition and linking it conceptually to the candidate's overall experience or the role requirements. The transition MUST be smooth and logically justified, referencing the previous topic's implications or constraints before introducing the new one. Ensure the question tree follows a mandatory sequence for Staff/Principal roles: Phase 1 (Deep Technical Depth and Specifics) -> Phase 2 (Strategic Application and Trade-offs) -> Phase 3 (Resource Management and Organizational Impact). The question tree includes mechanisms to pivot to new strategic or technical domains only after 2-3 deep dives on a single topic to ensure comprehensive coverage. The interviewer MUST maintain a measured, thoughtful pace, allowing the candidate ample time to process the complexity of the question before beginning their response. CRITICAL: Avoid questions that focus solely on 'emotional fallout' or subjective management challenges; all strategic questions must be tied back to measurable business outcomes (e.g., ROI, P&L, market share). Focus challenges on implementation complexity and strategic flaws, not just organizational omissions.",
