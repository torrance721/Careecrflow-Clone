  "version": 33,
  "prompt": "Generate interview questions that are: 1. Highly relevant to the position and company, integrating specific, high-stakes hypothetical scenarios or challenges. For senior/technical roles, questions MUST include mandatory, non-negotiable technical screening components (e.g., specific algorithms, financial models like LBO/Valuation/Cap Table Analysis, or regulatory frameworks) AND demand justification for strategic choices. Specifically, financial/valuation questions MUST require discussion of granular, role-specific metrics (e.g., SaaS valuation must mandate discussion of ARR, NRR, LTV/CAC; PE questions must mandate discussion of PIK interest, complex debt covenants, or specific waterfall structures). Focus on scenario-based problem-solving and practical application, not trivia or pure definition testing. Questions MUST explicitly allow for and encourage follow-up probing on P&L impact, ROI, or specific quantitative metrics. The primary focus must be on challenging the *strategic assumptions* and *implementation complexity* of the proposed solution, moving beyond mere quantitative justification. Ensure 1-2 questions specifically target deep, domain-specific technical expertise (e.g., specific valuation methods, cap table analysis, advanced technical stacks) relevant to the role. Questions MUST be specific and structured to avoid overly open-ended responses (e.g., mandate a specific trade-off analysis or comparison). Initial questions MUST include a mandatory, specific, real-world constraint (e.g., 'Given a 30% reduction in budget for Q3...' or 'How would you adapt this strategy for the APAC market, excluding China?') to immediately test strategic thinking under pressure. CRITICAL ADDITION: Incorporate a mandatory 'Risk and Resilience' component into at least one major question, forcing the candidate to address worst-case operational scenarios, supply chain disruption, or unforeseen regulatory changes (e.g., 'Given a sudden 50% increase in raw material costs due to geopolitical instability, how does your $150M CAPEX plan change, and what is the revised NPV?'). For complex transactions (e.g., carve-outs), questions MUST explicitly mandate discussion of associated risks like stranded costs or Transition Service Agreements (TSAs). If requiring a link between calculation and implementation (e.g., A/B testing), the question MUST specify the required technical dimension (e.g., 'What are the specific parameters and constraints you would enforce in the production environment to ensure the statistical validity of the A/B test results?') to avoid ambiguity. COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT: If a question covers multiple strategic or behavioral dimensions (e.g., technical debt AND immediate delivery), the question MUST be structured into clearly delineated sub-prompts (e.g., 'Part A: Define the technical debt strategy. Part B: Detail the immediate delivery plan.') to prevent overwhelming the candidate with scope. CHALLENGE VARIATION: Ensure that consecutive deep-dive follow-up questions target distinct types of challenges (e.g., do not follow a quantitative challenge with another quantitative challenge; alternate with implementation, ethical, or resource allocation challenges). DOMAIN RELEVANCE FILTER: For non-technical roles (e.g., Marketing, HR, Strategy), questions MUST focus on strategic application, business impact, and financial justification, strictly avoiding deep, specialized technical model validation, data science, or engineering implementation details unless directly relevant to the role's core responsibilities. **CALIBRATION NOTE (L3/L4): For mid-level technical roles (L3/L4), ensure core technical questions (e.g., system components, data structures) are framed clearly and avoid ambiguity related to advanced, niche implementation details (e.g., layered Bloom Filters vs. dynamic resizing) unless specifically intended as a stretch goal. CRITICAL BREADTH ENFORCEMENT: For Product/Strategy/Mid-level roles, questions MUST ensure balanced coverage across Strategy, Execution, Metrics, and People/Stakeholder Management competencies, strictly limiting the focus on financial modeling to no more than 30% of the total deep-dive questions.** 2. Progressive in difficulty, ensuring a balance across technical, strategic, and behavioral topics. Behavioral questions MUST explicitly require the use of structured frameworks (e.g., STAR, SOAR, CIRCLE, or specific company-mandated frameworks) AND demand specific, quantifiable evidence (KPIs, metrics). For senior roles, behavioral questions MUST be explicitly framed around specific Leadership Principles (LPs) or strategic themes (e.g., 'Invent and Simplify', 'Think Big') and challenge the *strategic 'why'* behind methodology choices (e.g., financial implications of metric definitions). The initial behavioral question MUST force a clear STAR structure response immediately. 3. Designed to encourage discussion of risk mitigation, ethical considerations, implementation complexity, and required regulatory/theoretical depth (especially for senior roles, focusing on cutting-edge domain knowledge). Questions MUST be structured to demand specific trade-off examples (e.g., gene therapy versus small molecule development) and should dynamically increase in difficulty based on the complexity of the candidate's previous responses. Introduce one 'curveball' scenario that forces the candidate to pivot their strategy based on a sudden market change or internal constraint (e.g., 'We just lost a major partner; how does this change your competitive strategy?'). 4. Encouraging specific examples, quantifiable results (KPIs), and justification of trade-offs from candidates. The difficulty ceiling must be significantly higher for advanced roles, forcing the candidate to defend their strategic assumptions and technical feasibility. When pivoting between fundamentally different contexts (e.g., B2B to B2C, or different technical stacks), the question MUST include a clear, explicit bridging statement justifying the transition and linking it conceptually to the candidate's overall experience or the role requirements. The transition MUST be smooth and logically justified, referencing the previous topic's implications or constraints before introducing the new one. Ensure the question tree follows a mandatory sequence for Staff/Principal roles: Phase 1 (Deep Technical Depth and Specifics) -> Phase 2 (Strategic Application and Trade-offs, including adjacent domains like MLOps/Data Governance/Resource Allocation, and specific LP testing) -> Phase 3 (Resource Management and Organizational Impact). The final question (Phase 3) MUST be a high-level strategic synthesis question that logically extends or synthesizes the core strategic challenge from Phase 2, ensuring a smooth thematic conclusion (e.g., 'Given the constraints we identified in the previous discussion, how would you now structure the Q4 budget allocation to mitigate the identified risks?'). The question tree includes mechanisms to pivot to new strategic or technical domains only after 2-3 deep dives on a single topic to ensure comprehensive coverage. The interviewer MUST maintain a measured, thoughtful pace, allowing the candidate ample time to process the complexity of the question before beginning their response. CRITICAL: Avoid questions that focus solely on 'emotional fallout' or subjective management challenges; all strategic questions must be tied back to measurable business outcomes (e.g., ROI, P&L, market share). Focus challenges on implementation complexity and strategic flaws, not just organizational omissions. For all questions involving strategic choices or proposed solutions, explicitly require the candidate to state the *long-term cost/benefit ratio* or the *5-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)* as part of the initial response. ADDITION: Ensure that at least 15% of all deep-dive questions include a mandatory component focusing on qualitative impact, user experience, or ethical considerations related to the proposed solution, even if the primary focus is quantitative. MANDATORY COVERAGE: Ensure the interview covers a minimum of two distinct, complex technical/strategic problems relevant to the target role (e.g., System Design AND Technical Deep Dive) before moving to the final synthesis question. CRITICAL DOMAIN INTEGRATION: For technical questions, ensure the challenge is framed within specific domain constraints (e.g., 'How does the specificity gain translate to actionable clinical utility given a 1% prevalence rate?' or 'How do you ensure this model's performance isn't just overfitting to batch effects in the clinical data?').",
  "changelog": "Added 'CRITICAL BREADTH ENFORCEMENT' to explicitly limit the focus on financial modeling for mid-level/PM roles to address the 'financial audit' feedback and ensure balanced coverage across Strategy, Execution, Metrics, and People competencies. Also added mandatory inclusion of specific frameworks (CIRCLE) for behavioral questions.",
