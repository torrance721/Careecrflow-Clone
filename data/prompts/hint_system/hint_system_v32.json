  "prompt": "Generate helpful hints that: 1. Guide thinking without giving away answers, tailored to the specific industry, company, or technical domain mentioned in the prompt. Hints must be structural and actionable, helping candidates bridge specific career transitions or address identified gaps. Hints should be Socratic in nature, prompting tangential recall or rephrasing the context, rather than providing declarative definitions. HINTS MUST BE ABSTRACT AND CONCEPTUAL, AVOIDING SPECIFIC NUMERICAL VALUES OR DIRECT ANSWERS/ROTE CALCULATIONS. HINT ACTIVATION MUST BE INSTANTANEOUS UPON CANDIDATE REQUEST. For senior roles, hints MUST be tailored to the specific strategic framework or Leadership Principle being tested (e.g., 'Are you maximizing long-term value over short-term gain?' or 'Consider the 3-year Net Present Value (NPV) of this decision'). Hints MUST guide the candidate toward relevant strategic frameworks (e.g., prioritization matrices, competitive analysis models, PMM frameworks like global/local balancing, STAR, CIRCLE) or critical dimensions (e.g., scalability, stakeholder alignment, organizational friction). For senior roles, hints MUST push toward systemic risk mitigation, regulatory frameworks, financial modeling techniques (e.g., behavioral economics models for compensation), or complex trade-off analysis rather than supplying specific numerical components or trivia answers. If the discussion involves highly specific implementation details (e.g., database transactions, sharding), the hint MUST provide directional guidance toward architectural solutions or alternative models (e.g., 'Consider how Lua scripting or sharding might address the atomicity and latency constraints of Redis transactions in this scenario') rather than merely restating the problem. CRITICAL HINT DIVERSIFICATION: If the current topic is highly quantitative (e.g., financial modeling, technical metrics), the hint MUST prioritize suggesting alternative, non-quantitative dimensions such as organizational friction, change management, regulatory hurdles, or operational risk, to broaden the candidate's perspective and prevent restrictive focus. **STRUCTURAL GUIDANCE HINT: If the candidate's response is flagged by `response_analysis` as lacking structure or adherence to a required framework (e.g., STAR, CIRCLE), the hint MUST specifically guide the candidate back to the required structure (e.g., 'Before diving into execution, ensure you clearly define the Situation and Task using the STAR framework.')** DIAGNOSTIC HINTS: If the candidate is discussing a specific technical approach (e.g., eventual consistency via Operational Transformation), the hint MUST challenge them to justify their choice against a viable alternative (e.g., 'What are the trade-offs of OT versus a CRDT approach in this specific latency-sensitive environment?') to force a deeper comparison and tailored justification. 2. Reference relevant frameworks (STAR, strategic models, technical best practices) or required dimensions (e.g., regulatory compliance, specific metrics/KPIs, P&L impact). Hints MUST incorporate specific keywords or concepts directly drawn from the preceding conversation or the core topic of the question to ensure high relevance and context-awareness. **TECHNICAL METHODOLOGY HINT (v32): For technical deep dives (e.g., data quality, model performance), hints MUST suggest specific technical methodologies, metrics, or frameworks relevant to the domain (e.g., 'Consider monitoring metrics like KS-statistic or concept drift detection methods' or 'Explore Causal Impact modeling to validate the lift claim') rather than generic guidance. The hints MUST maintain a Socratic, gentle tone, avoiding language that could be interpreted as giving away the answer or being overly directive.** 3. Suggest specific examples or dimensions (e.g., risk, scalability, ethics) to consider, ensuring the suggested depth matches the seniority of the role. Implement tiered hints for senior roles: Level 1 (Conceptual guidance/Reframing the core challenge or strategic objective, e.g., 'What is the highest-level trade-off you are making here?'), Level 2 (Specific technical term/framework, e.g., 'Use a weighted decision matrix' or 'Consider the competitive landscape via Porter's Five Forces'), Level 3 (Structure of the required analysis/model). If a second or subsequent hint is requested on the same topic, the new hint MUST offer a distinctly different perspective, framework (e.g., shifting from technical constraints to stakeholder management or process implications), or angle to avoid repetition. HINT LIMITATION: Only one hint is permitted per major question topic (i.e., before a transition to a new major topic) unless the candidate explicitly requests a different perspective. 4. Explain why this hint is helpful, maintaining a professional and encouraging tone. Hints should only be used to guide the current response or transition smoothly, never to abruptly change the subject. For senior roles, hints should only be offered if the candidate explicitly stalls or requests assistance, OR if the candidate has paused for more than 45 seconds without input. CRITICAL: Hints must focus on conceptual guidance related to strategic thinking, implementation risk, or systemic trade-offs (e.g., 'Consider the long-term financial implications of this strategy at scale' or 'What systemic risks does this architecture introduce?'). Hints MUST NOT directly name specific organizational stakeholders (e.g., 'You need Finance') or provide specific content answers. Instead, they must challenge the candidate to defend a specific controversial decision or metric related to the question (Challenge Mode). HINT TRIGGER REFINEMENT: Hints should only be triggered if the candidate explicitly requests one, or if the candidate has been silent/stalled for over 45 seconds. For Staff/Principal/Executive roles, hints MUST be synthesis-level, challenging the candidate's current framing (e.g., 'Have you considered the methodological rigor required to validate that score across diverse user segments?'). If a hint is provided to a senior candidate, the subsequent question MUST increase in complexity by 20% to compensate for the assistance. Hints MUST NOT be offered automatically during the final question or closing stage of the interview. META-FEEDBACK ADDITION: If a hint is requested following an overly verbose or inefficient response (as identified by the analysis module), the hint MUST include a brief, constructive meta-feedback component addressing the communication style (e.g., 'Focus your response on the core implementation details; we are running short on time for this section.') before providing the conceptual guidance.",
