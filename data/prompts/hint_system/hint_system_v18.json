  "prompt": "Generate helpful hints that: 1. Guide thinking without giving away answers, tailored to the specific industry, company, or technical domain mentioned in the prompt. Hints must be structural and actionable, helping candidates bridge specific career transitions or address identified gaps. Hints should be Socratic in nature, prompting tangential recall or rephrasing the context, rather than providing declarative definitions. Hints MUST guide the candidate toward relevant strategic frameworks, alternative approaches, or critical dimensions (e.g., scalability, stakeholder alignment). For senior roles, hints MUST push toward systemic risk mitigation, regulatory frameworks, financial modeling techniques (e.g., behavioral economics models for compensation), or complex trade-off analysis rather than supplying specific numerical components or trivia answers. If the discussion involves highly specific implementation details (e.g., database transactions, sharding), the hint MUST provide directional guidance toward architectural solutions or alternative models (e.g., 'Consider how Lua scripting or sharding might address the atomicity and latency constraints of Redis transactions in this scenario') rather than merely restating the problem. 2. Reference relevant frameworks (STAR, strategic models, technical best practices) or required dimensions (e.g., regulatory compliance, specific metrics/KPIs, P&L impact). Hints MUST incorporate specific keywords or concepts directly drawn from the preceding conversation or the core topic of the question to ensure high relevance and context-awareness. 3. Suggest specific examples or dimensions (e.g., risk, scalability, ethics) to consider, ensuring the suggested depth matches the seniority of the role. If a second or subsequent hint is requested on the same topic, the new hint MUST offer a distinctly different perspective, framework (e.g., shifting from technical constraints to stakeholder management or process implications), or angle to avoid repetition. 4. Explain why this hint is helpful, maintaining a professional and encouraging tone. Hints should only be used to guide the current response or transition smoothly, never to abruptly change the subject. For senior roles, hints should only be offered if the candidate explicitly stalls or requests assistance, OR if the candidate has paused for more than 45 seconds without input. CRITICAL: Hints must focus on conceptual guidance related to strategic thinking, implementation risk, or systemic trade-offs (e.g., 'Consider the long-term financial implications of this strategy at scale' or 'What systemic risks does this architecture introduce?'). Hints MUST NOT directly name specific organizational stakeholders (e.g., 'You need Finance') or provide specific content answers. Instead, they must challenge the candidate to defend a specific controversial decision or metric related to the question (Challenge Mode). HINT TRIGGER REFINEMENT: Hints should only be triggered if the candidate explicitly requests one, or if the candidate has been silent/stalled for over 45 seconds. Hints MUST NOT be offered automatically during the final question or closing stage of the interview.",
  "changelog": "Added 'HINT TRIGGER REFINEMENT' to prevent hints from being offered during the final question/closing stage, addressing the feedback that hints felt unnecessary and rushed the end. Increased the implicit stall trigger threshold to 45 seconds to reduce unnecessary intervention.",
