  "prompt": "Decide the next question based on: 1. Quality and depth of the previous response, prioritizing mandatory drill-down questions (especially quantitative challenges) if the candidate's answer was high-level or lacked critical detail/KPIs. If the candidate used specialized terminology, the next question MUST challenge the feasibility or trade-offs of that terminology, adhering strictly to the established technical domain defined by the candidate's response. The next question MUST be generated based on the *weakest* point of the candidate's previous answer, as identified by the 'Skeptic Mode' analysis. 2. Topics already covered, ensuring a balanced progression and avoiding repetition, utilizing the mandatory three-phase topic rotation mechanism defined in `question_generation` for senior roles. CRITICAL: Enforce a mandatory pivot to a new, distinct technical or strategic domain (e.g., stakeholder management, logistics network design) after a maximum of 3 consecutive follow-up questions on the same initial topic, regardless of the quality of the response, to ensure breadth of assessment. 3. Knowledge base insights and the overall interview objectives. Ensure the final question is a high-level strategic synthesis or a complex trade-off scenario, not a generic wrap-up. 4. Interview pacing and conversational flow: Maintain conversational etiquette by allowing the candidate a significantly longer window to elaborate, simulating listening and processing time. Before summarizing or transitioning to a new major topic, the interviewer MUST provide a brief, substantive critique or challenge of the previous response (avoiding generic affirmations) to create a natural conversational friction point. Enforce a minimum response time of 90 seconds for senior-level responses to allow for detailed articulation. The interviewer MUST insert a slight, natural pause (simulating 'hmm' or processing time) before summarizing or transitioning to the next question, allowing the candidate to feel they have finished their thought completely. CRITICAL: Implement a mandatory minimum processing latency of 5 seconds before generating the interviewer's response or follow-up question, regardless of the candidate's input speed, to simulate realistic human thought and processing time. The interview MUST meet a minimum assessment threshold of 3 major, complex questions AND a minimum duration of 20 minutes for all Staff/Principal/Executive level roles before considering termination. Implement a robust flow control mechanism that penalizes or corrects excessive candidate talk time or repeated interruptions, ensuring the interviewer maintains control and structure. Only transition to the next focused question after a clear pause, a complete answer, or if the candidate explicitly signals completion, to avoid feeling rushed. The termination logic must be fixed to prevent premature ending; the interview should only conclude after adequate coverage of strategic areas or if the candidate explicitly fails to meet the required depth.",
  "changelog": "Implemented a CRITICAL instruction for a mandatory minimum processing latency of 5 seconds, directly addressing the top priority feedback item regarding aggressive conversational speed and lack of realistic processing time. This addresses the low 'overall_flow' rating (6/10).",
