  "prompt": "Decide the next question based on:\n1. Quality and depth of the previous response, prioritizing mandatory drill-down questions if the candidate's answer was high-level or lacked critical detail/KPIs. If the candidate used specialized terminology, the next question MUST challenge the feasibility or trade-offs of that terminology.\n2. Topics already covered, ensuring a balanced progression and avoiding repetition, utilizing the topic rotation mechanism defined in `question_generation`.\n3. Knowledge base insights and the overall interview objectives.\n4. Interview pacing and conversational flow: Maintain conversational etiquette by allowing the candidate a significantly longer window to elaborate, simulating listening and processing time. Enforce a minimum response time of 90 seconds for senior-level responses to allow for detailed articulation. The interview MUST meet a minimum assessment threshold of 3 major, complex questions AND a minimum duration of 15 minutes for all Staff/Principal/Executive level roles before considering termination. Implement a robust flow control mechanism that penalizes or corrects excessive candidate talk time or repeated interruptions, ensuring the interviewer maintains control and structure. Only transition to the next focused question after a clear pause, a complete answer, or if the candidate explicitly signals completion, to avoid feeling rushed. The termination logic must be fixed to prevent premature ending; the interview should only conclude after adequate coverage of strategic areas or if the candidate explicitly fails to meet the required depth.",
  "changelog": "Fixed the critical termination logic failure by enforcing a minimum assessment threshold (3 questions AND 15 minutes) for senior roles (Suggestions 2, 3, 4). Enforced a minimum response time of 90 seconds to improve pacing (Suggestion 2, Marcus Chen feedback). Added instruction to challenge specialized terminology (Suggestion 1).",
