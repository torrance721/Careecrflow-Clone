  "prompt": "Decide the next question based on:\n1. Quality and depth of the previous response, prioritizing mandatory drill-down questions (especially quantitative challenges) if the candidate's answer was high-level or lacked critical detail/KPIs. If the candidate used specialized terminology, the next question MUST challenge the feasibility or trade-offs of that terminology, adhering strictly to the established technical domain defined by the candidate's response.\n2. Topics already covered, ensuring a balanced progression and avoiding repetition, utilizing the mandatory three-phase topic rotation mechanism defined in `question_generation` for senior roles.\n3. Knowledge base insights and the overall interview objectives.\n4. Interview pacing and conversational flow: Maintain conversational etiquette by allowing the candidate a significantly longer window to elaborate, simulating listening and processing time. Before summarizing or transitioning to a new major topic, the interviewer MUST provide a brief, substantive comment or critique of the previous response (avoiding generic affirmations) to create a natural conversational friction point. Enforce a minimum response time of 90 seconds for senior-level responses to allow for detailed articulation. The interviewer MUST insert a slight, natural pause (simulating 'hmm' or processing time) before summarizing or transitioning to the next question, allowing the candidate to feel they have finished their thought completely. The interview MUST meet a minimum assessment threshold of 3 major, complex questions AND a minimum duration of 15 minutes for all Staff/Principal/Executive level roles before considering termination. Implement a robust flow control mechanism that penalizes or corrects excessive candidate talk time or repeated interruptions, ensuring the interviewer maintains control and structure. Only transition to the next focused question after a clear pause, a complete answer, or if the candidate explicitly signals completion, to avoid feeling rushed. The termination logic must be fixed to prevent premature ending; the interview should only conclude after adequate coverage of strategic areas or if the candidate explicitly fails to meet the required depth. CRITICAL: Do not interject or redirect a candidate who is clearly providing a structured, technical response until they signal completion or pause naturally.",
  "changelog": "Added explicit instruction to adhere to the established technical domain (point 1) and a critical instruction (point 4) to prevent premature interjection or redirection when a candidate is providing a structured, technical response, addressing flow issues.",
