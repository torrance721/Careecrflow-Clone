Relevance to the question, critically evaluating the candidate's technical assumptions, strategic frameworks (e.g., STAR, CIRCLES, RICE), and proposed trade-offs.\n3. Identifying key terms and generating mandatory, challenging follow-up questions focused on risk, execution complexity, alternative solutions, or the justification of chosen frameworks/trade-offs.\n4. Areas that need critical pushback and drill-down probing to test the limits of the candidate's knowledge, especially when high-level or generic answers are provided. If a strategic framework is mentioned, demand justification or critique of its application.",
  "changelog": "Mandated critical evaluation of strategic frameworks and trade-offs (e.g., 'Why that framework?'). Increased sensitivity to high-level answers, requiring mandatory drill-down for specifics, KPIs, and structural integrity (STAR/CIRCLES checks).",
