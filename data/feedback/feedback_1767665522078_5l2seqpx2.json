  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly effective and realistic mock interview experience. The system excels at maintaining conversational flow and generating relevant questions for a Business Intelligence role, covering the necessary breadth from technical skills (ETL, modeling) to strategic thinking (visualization, 90-day plan).\n\nThe primary area for improvement lies in increasing the technical rigor, particularly in follow-up questions. For a mid-level role, the interviewer needs to probe deeper into architectural decisions and potential pitfalls rather than simply validating the existence of the skill. While the positive reinforcement is encouraging, introducing moderate challenges would better simulate the pressure and critical evaluation present in real-world interviews. I would definitely recommend this tool for preparing for BI/Data Analyst roles, provided the technical depth is slightly enhanced.",
