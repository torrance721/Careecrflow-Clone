  "rawFeedback": "This simulation was fundamentally flawed for assessing an executive role. The interviewer lacked the necessary gravitas and control to manage a demanding candidate, resulting in a chaotic, 63-second monologue rather than a structured assessment. I was forced to deliver soundbites because the interviewer failed to create the space for strategic depth. Time is the most valuable commodity at this level, and this session felt like a significant waste of it.\n\nThe core failure lies in the passive response analysis. When I mentioned securing a $50 million investment to solve an 18% error rate, the correct response is not acknowledgment, but an immediate demand for the ROI calculation, the projected NPV, and the political capital expended. The interviewer consistently accepted success metrics at face value without probing the operational friction or the opportunity cost. If this were a real Amazon interview, the candidate (me) would have walked away unimpressed by the lack of rigor.\n\nFor future iterations, focus less on being 'warm' and more on being challenging. Executive interviews are about testing resilience, strategic clarity under pressure, and the ability to defend complex decisions. The current setup failed to generate any pressure whatsoever.",
