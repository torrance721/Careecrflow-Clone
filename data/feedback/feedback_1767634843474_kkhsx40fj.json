  "rawFeedback": "This simulation provided a decent, high-level overview but fundamentally failed to deliver the rigorous, penetrating challenge required for a VP-level role at a company like Amazon. The questions touched upon complex topics—CAPEX investment, digital transformation, performance governance—but the follow-up lacked the necessary operational realism and quantitative rigor. I expect an interviewer at this level to aggressively challenge my assumptions, demand detailed financial metrics, and probe the failure modes of my largest initiatives. Instead, the system often validated my answers, which is the antithesis of a high-stakes executive interview.\n\nThe most significant failure was the lack of focus on risk mitigation. Accepting the 48-hour SAP decommissioning without demanding a detailed contingency plan or questioning the supply chain resilience implications is a major oversight. Furthermore, the persona simulation needs refinement; the interviewer was too polite and relied too heavily on generic praise. I am looking for an interviewer who can debate me on the merits of a multi-million dollar strategy, not simply nod along.\n\nWhile the system is functional and maintained context well, it needs to be calibrated for true executive scrutiny. The suggestions provided focus on injecting mandatory quantitative demands, increasing the focus on risk, and programming a more skeptical, demanding interviewer persona. This is the only way to make the simulation valuable for candidates operating at the highest levels of global operations.",
