  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a very challenging but effective mock interview. The system excels at deep-diving into specific project details, particularly metrics, which is crucial for a mid-level role. I appreciated that the interviewer's tone remained professional and encouraging throughout, even when the questions were highly demanding. This positive framing really helped me push through the moments where I felt overwhelmed.\n\nMy main constructive feedback revolves around pacing and scope. The intensity level was almost too high for the entire duration; a human interviewer would likely provide a brief conversational break. Furthermore, while I understand the need to scrutinize metrics, the focus on statistical normalization and the exact math behind the percentage calculation felt slightly outside the primary scope of a Product Designer and leaned more towards a data science role. I would recommend balancing the quantitative scrutiny with more emphasis on design thinking, user research, and strategic decision-making to make the simulation perfect for a UX role.",
