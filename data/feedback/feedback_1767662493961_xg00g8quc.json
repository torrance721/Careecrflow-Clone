  "rawFeedback": "This simulation, while strong in its ability to generate high-level, relevant questions targeting methodological rigor, failed significantly on execution and flow. The core problem is repetition: the interviewer got stuck asking the same 'mechanism' question three times in a row, which immediately broke the immersion and felt like a technical glitch, not a human interviewer.\n\nFor this tool to be genuinely competitive with human coaching, it needs to move beyond simple context tracking and implement proactive challenge mechanisms. A top-tier interviewer would never accept my attribution claims without asking about external factors, and they would certainly pivot topics after extracting the core details of a single project. The current system extracts information efficiently but does not test the candidate's resilience or breadth of knowledge.\n\nI need actionable tools. The hint system is currently useless because it lacks specificity. If I am struggling with a diagnostic question, I need a template or a comparative example—not a vague prompt to 'elaborate.' If the AI cannot provide the specific, comparative guidance a human mentor would offer (e.g., 'Here is how a Senior Designer structures that answer'), then its utility is severely limited for demanding users like myself.",
