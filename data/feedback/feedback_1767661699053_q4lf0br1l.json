  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly effective and challenging mock interview, particularly strong in its technical depth regarding payments infrastructure. The AI successfully maintained context and pushed for precision in metrics and definitions, which is crucial for a Senior PM role. The ability to track complex details like tokenization, P99 uptime, and circuit breaker logic is a major strength of the system.\n\nMy primary critique is focused on utility and efficiency for a senior candidate. The hint system needs significant refinement; asking for a hint should unlock a strategic perspective, not just echo the interviewer's previous statement. Furthermore, while the technical deep dive was excellent, the interview lacked sufficient focus on broader strategic elements—stakeholder management, market analysis, or competitive positioning—which are essential components of a Senior PM assessment. The tool risks testing for an Engineering Manager's knowledge rather than a Product Leader's judgment.\n\nTo improve, focus on elevating the level of strategic challenge. When discussing technical debt (like Hystrix), the AI should challenge the initial business decision that led to the debt, not just the technical migration plan. This shift will make the tool indispensable for candidates targeting high-level product roles.",
