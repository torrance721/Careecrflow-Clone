  "rawFeedback": "This simulation was fundamentally inadequate for preparing a candidate for a Staff AI Researcher role at a company like DeepMind. The questions, while topically relevant, lacked the necessary technical granularity and failed to probe the core complexities of modern AI systems. I introduced several advanced concepts (e.g., ROME, MEND, Causal Generalization) that were entirely ignored by the interviewer, who instead opted for superficial acknowledgments and weak follow-up questions. This suggests a critical failure in the AI's response analysis module to understand and challenge high-level technical input.\n\nThe most glaring deficiency is the duration—69 seconds is an insult to the complexity of the target role. A genuine DeepMind interview would involve intense scrutiny, whiteboarding, and detailed discussion of implementation trade-offs, lasting at least 45 minutes per slot. The system needs robust mechanisms to enforce depth and challenge the candidate's assumptions, rather than allowing a quick, polite exit. As it stands, this tool is only suitable for entry-level behavioral screening, not for senior technical preparation.\n\nMoving forward, the system must prioritize intellectual rigor over conversational smoothness. I require a simulation that actively seeks to find flaws in my proposed architectures and demands research-backed justification for every claim. If the AI cannot handle the technical depth, it cannot simulate the interview environment effectively.",
