  "rawFeedback": "The simulation, while structurally sound in its progression from cultural challenge to operational defense, failed to maintain the necessary level of critical scrutiny required for a Chief Innovation Officer role. The pacing was acceptable, but the follow-up questions lacked the necessary depth to truly test strategic thinking and quantitative rigor. Specifically, the system was far too quick to accept complex quantitative claims (like the 'Net Value Add') without demanding the underlying financial model or methodological validation. This is a fundamental flaw when interviewing a highly analytical executive.\n\nThe simulation concluded prematurely, suggesting the system reached its complexity limit after the candidate successfully defended a single trade-off. Executive interviews are not resolved by a single successful answer; they are continuous probes into strategic breadth and resilience. For this tool to be viable for C-level assessment, the complexity and skepticism indices must be significantly increased, and the response analysis must incorporate a mandatory financial validation layer. Immediate structural fixes are required to prevent this from being merely a tactical assessment tool disguised as a strategic one.",
