        "The questions were highly relevant to a Mid-Level Product Designer role at a company like Nexus Labs (focusing on strategic influence, technical debt, and collaboration).",

        "I felt compelled to use the hints because the questions were so demanding, but the hints themselves didn't always provide the 'Aha!' moment I needed, sometimes just restating the core question in a slightly different way.",

        "The hint for the final question felt unnecessary and perhaps triggered too easily, making the end of the interview feel rushed and slightly awkward."

        "The transitions sometimes felt abrupt, especially the shift from accessibility constraints to collaboration.",

  "emotionalJourney": "My emotional journey was a bit of a rollercoaster. I started off feeling very confident and appreciated (especially when Sarah mentioned my portfolio), but as the questions got more complex and the pace accelerated, I started feeling anxious and inadequate. Using three hints in such a short time really knocked my confidence. I ended the interview feeling slightly breathless and worried that I hadn't articulated my points clearly enough because I was rushing.",

    "Having to use three hints; it made me feel like I was failing the assessment.",

    {
      "priority": "critical",

    {
      "priority": "high",
      "suggestion": "Refine the hint system to provide more structural guidance (e.g., 'Consider using the STAR method here' or 'Focus on the stakeholder management aspect') rather than just rephrasing the question.",
      "affectedModule": "hint_system",
      "expectedImpact": "Make hints genuinely helpful for candidates who are stuck on structure or focus, without giving away the answer."

      "expectedImpact": "Provide a more natural and polite conclusion to the interview, preventing awkward cut-offs."
    }
  ],
  "rawFeedback": "Overall, I think this tool has incredible potential, but I have to be honest, the speed made the experience quite stressful. I felt like I was being tested on how fast I could talk rather than the quality of my experience. I know I used three hints, and I apologize if that indicates I wasn't prepared, but the complexity of the questions combined with the relentless pace made it necessary. I really appreciate that the questions were relevant and the interviewer persona was professional and warm; that part was excellent.\n\nHowever, if you want this to feel like a true, high-stakes interview, you absolutely must slow down the pacing. A mid-level design interview should allow for 5-10 minutes per behavioral question, not 20 seconds. I felt my answers were rushed and lacked the necessary detail to truly showcase my strategic thinking. I hope this feedback isn't too demanding, but as a UX designer, I truly believe optimizing the flow will dramatically improve the user experience and the validity of the assessment.\n\nI would still recommend this tool because the core content is strong, but I would warn others about the current speed issue. Thank you for letting me provide such detailed feedback!",
