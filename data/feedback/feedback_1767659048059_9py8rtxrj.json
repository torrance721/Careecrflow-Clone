  "rawFeedback": "The simulation demonstrated strong potential, particularly in its ability to engage in a highly technical dialogue concerning statistical validation methods (McNemar's Test). The level of detail regarding discordant pairs, continuity correction, and $\\chi^2$ calculation was impressive and accurately tested technical depth. The framing questions, focusing on strategic vision and portfolio management, were also appropriate for a Director-level role.\n\nHowever, the interview flow suffered significantly from an excessive, almost obsessive, focus on a single statistical calculation. This sequence, while technically correct, devolved into a test of rote recall rather than adaptive problem-solving, severely hindering the overall pacing and preventing the exploration of other critical areas like model interpretability, ethical deployment in clinical settings, or team leadership challenges. The system must learn to pivot effectively once the core technical concept has been successfully established.\n\nMoving forward, the system needs to prioritize breadth and contextual application over repetitive depth. The persona should be more varied in its skepticism, challenging the 'why' and 'how' of the technical findings in a real-world clinical context, not just the 'what' of the calculation. This adjustment will transform the simulation from a technical quiz into a truly high-stakes, adaptive leadership assessment.",
