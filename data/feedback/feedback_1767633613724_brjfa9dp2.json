  "emotionalJourney": "My emotional journey was one of intense focus and slight irritation. I had to compress complex, multi-faceted answers (like the chargeback model) into soundbites because the system was moving at an unsustainable speed.

I felt intellectually stimulated by the quality of the questions but frustrated by the lack of conversational breathing room.",
  "frustratingMoments": [
    "The transition speed between my answer and the interviewer's next question was nearly instantaneous, which felt like being rushed or cut off.",

  "rawFeedback": "The system demonstrates a strong capability in generating high-quality, strategically relevant questions appropriate for a very senior technical leadership role. The progression from platform efficiency to financial governance was excellent, showcasing a good understanding of the VP of Engineering scope. I was impressed that the system successfully tracked and referenced specific models I mentioned, such as the NCUH structure, demonstrating strong contextual awareness.\n\nHowever, the execution was severely flawed by the pacing. The interview was conducted at an unnatural, breakneck speed (6 complex questions in under two minutes). This forced me, as the candidate, to abandon depth and structural integrity—the very things I prioritize—in favor of rapid, high-level summaries. This lack of conversational flow significantly detracted from the realism and reduced the opportunity for a thorough assessment of my strategic thinking.\n\nTo improve, the system must prioritize realistic cadence over efficiency. Slowing down the pace, varying the feedback language, and occasionally introducing friction or challenge into the conversation will elevate this from a rapid-fire Q&A session to a genuinely challenging and valuable mock interview experience.",
