  "rawFeedback": "As a backend engineer, I appreciated that the core technical problem—dealing with high-volume log ingestion and retrieval—was relevant to real-world challenges. My approach using Hash Maps and Min-Heaps was validated, which confirms the system's ability to recognize efficient solutions. However, the simulation failed drastically in terms of structure and scope. The entire interview lasted less than three minutes, covering only a single technical question. This is wholly inadequate for an SDE II role assessment and makes the simulation feel like a brief warm-up rather than a comprehensive screening. The system needs robust checks to ensure the interview length and question count meet the expected standard for the target job level.\n\nFurthermore, the interviewer persona lacked the necessary rigor to manage the conversation. I was overly verbose, spending too much time providing context and anecdotes. A real interviewer would have intervened quickly to conserve time, yet the system repeatedly validated my 'thorough' explanations. This failure to enforce efficient communication is a major flaw, as one of the primary goals of a mock interview is to refine communication efficiency. The three hints I requested were largely due to this inefficient flow, and the lack of feedback on *why* I needed them was a missed opportunity.\n\nMy primary recommendation is to immediately rectify the flow module to ensure realistic time constraints and question depth are maintained. Secondly, integrate a stronger communication analysis component that actively coaches the candidate on conciseness and time management, rather than passively accepting lengthy responses. The technical foundation is solid, but the simulation framework is critically broken.",
