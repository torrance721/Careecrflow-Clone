  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the system provides a solid framework for a behavioral and strategic mock interview, but it falls short on the technical rigor required for a Private Equity Associate role at a firm like Blackstone. The topics covered were relevant (SaaS valuation, carve-outs, value creation), but the depth of the questions was insufficient. I expected questions that tested my ability to handle complex debt structures, detailed waterfall analyses, or specific operational modeling challenges, not just high-level strategic discussions.\n\nThe most critical issue is the lack of challenge and the rapid pacing. A 121-second interview covering six complex topics is unrealistic and undermines the value of the practice. The AI needs to be programmed to push back, demand quantification, and integrate firm-specific knowledge to truly simulate the high-stakes environment of a top-tier PE interview. While the flow was good, the superficiality of the interaction limits its utility for experienced candidates seeking genuine technical preparation.",
