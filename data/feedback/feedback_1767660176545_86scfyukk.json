  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly engaging and technically rigorous mock interview, achieving a good breadth of coverage in a short time. The questions on Bloom Filters and collaborative editing were excellent choices for assessing a Software Engineer II candidate's ability to handle scale and concurrency. I particularly appreciated the smooth transition between these disparate topics.\n\nHowever, the primary area for improvement lies in the conversational dynamics and the depth of the technical challenge. The interviewer repeatedly interrupted my detailed explanations with overly positive affirmations before pivoting. As a candidate focused on technical accuracy and trade-offs, I need the AI to push back harder, questioning the specific engineering decisions I propose rather than just summarizing my high-level points. This lack of rigorous challenge detracts from the realism required for high-stakes interviews.\n\nMy suggestion is to prioritize developing a more adaptive response analysis module that actively seeks out and challenges the quantitative aspects of the candidate's claims. If this refinement is made, the system would provide a much more accurate and challenging simulation, helping me optimize my communication style under pressure.",
