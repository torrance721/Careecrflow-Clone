  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly effective and strategically challenging mock interview, perfectly tailored for a Director-level Product Marketing role. The AI excelled at pushing my thinking beyond execution and into enterprise-wide organizational alignment and governance structures. The questions were top-tier, forcing me to articulate complex concepts like financial accountability (CLV:CAC) and behavior modification (TSAI/SRS).\n\nMy primary area for improvement focuses on the structure of the challenges. While I appreciate the need to cover all organizational bases, the flow felt slightly rigid—as if the AI was checking off a list of required stakeholders (Product, CS, Finance, Marketing, Executive Governance) rather than engaging purely with the strategic merit of my answers. This was exacerbated by the hints, which were too prescriptive, offering shortcuts instead of requiring deeper strategic synthesis.\n\nI recommend refining the hint system and diversifying the interviewer's phrasing. If these minor adjustments are made, this tool will be indispensable for candidates preparing for senior leadership roles where strategic clarity and organizational scope are paramount.",
