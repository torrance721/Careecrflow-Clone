  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a very challenging and useful mock interview. The questions were highly relevant to moving from a specialist role to a manager role, focusing heavily on strategic thinking, delegation, and process improvement, which is exactly what I needed.\n\nThe main area for improvement is the pacing and the level of technical detail. The questions about mathematical modeling and Chi-Squared tests went beyond what a Digital Marketing Manager would typically handle and made the conversation feel overly academic. I recommend ensuring the questions stay focused on the *application* and *business impact* of processes, rather than the underlying data science methodology.\n\nI would definitely recommend this tool. The AI was good at challenging my answers and the personalized closing summary was a great touch. Just a slight adjustment to the speed and the technical depth would make it perfect.",
