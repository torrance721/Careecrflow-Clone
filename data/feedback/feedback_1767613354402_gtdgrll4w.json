  "rawFeedback": "This mock interview was an exercise in inefficiency. For a Director-level role at Tesla, the assessment must be rigorous, broad, and challenging. This session was none of those things. The system got stuck in a repetitive loop, failing to recognize the strategic depth of my answers and insisting on re-litigating the same risk factor. This wasted my time and demonstrated a fundamental lack of sophistication in the response analysis module.\n\nFurthermore, terminating the interview after 62 seconds is unacceptable. It suggests the system is either unstable or fundamentally incapable of running a proper executive assessment. If this tool is meant to prepare candidates for high-stakes roles, it must simulate a full, challenging conversation that covers multiple strategic pillars, not just one narrow risk area.\n\nI expect immediate correction on the flow and termination logic. The content needs to be sharper and the interviewer needs to challenge the *viability* of the proposed solutions, not just restate the initial problem. Currently, I cannot recommend this tool for executive preparation.",
