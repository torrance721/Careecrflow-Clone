  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this tool shows a lot of promise, especially in the quality of the questions generated. They were highly relevant to an Associate Brand Manager role at a company like Nike, focusing on strategy, cultural relevance, and budget allocation. This is exactly what I need to practice.\n\nHowever, the usability was severely impacted by the speed of the interaction. The entire 65-second duration felt like a technical glitch, where the system was racing through the script. In a real corporate setting, we spend time on introductions and deep dives, not speed-reading. The constant interruption of the interviewer's dialogue made the experience feel transactional and broke the immersion. For a tool designed to simulate human interaction, the flow needs significant refinement to feel natural and conversational.\n\nMy primary suggestion is to prioritize fixing the pacing. If the system allows the interviewer to speak fully and allows the candidate time to formulate a thoughtful response without being rushed, the overall satisfaction and realism will jump dramatically. I would still recommend this tool because the core content is strong, but users need to be warned about the current speed issue.",
