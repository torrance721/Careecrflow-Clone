  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the framework and selection of topics for the interview were excellent and highly relevant to a Senior Platform Product Manager role. The questions themselves demonstrated a strong understanding of the challenges inherent in moving from Growth to Platform, specifically around technical debt and stakeholder alignment. \n\nHowever, the execution was severely flawed by the pacing. Completing four complex questions in just over a minute renders the practice useless for developing structured communication skills. As a candidate, I was forced to abandon my planned use of frameworks (like STAR for the technical debt question) because the system moved on before I could complete the Context or Action steps. The response analysis needs to be dramatically improved to prioritize structure and depth over simple topic recognition. If I say I use a 'three-pronged approach,' the system must challenge me to define the prongs and justify the method, rather than simply accepting the statement and moving to the next question.\n\nTo be a truly valuable tool, the AI must slow down, listen fully, and actively probe for the frameworks and quantitative results expected in a high-stakes interview. The potential is clearly there, but the current implementation feels like a broken record stuck on fast-forward.",
