  "rawFeedback": "The system, while functional, operates with a significant deficit in intellectual rigor required for executive-level technical interviews. My background as a CTO demands that I evaluate systems based on their structural logic and efficiency; in this case, the logic was weak, allowing for easy evasion of substantive technical discussion in favor of generic leadership narratives. The interview failed to stress-test my ability to defend complex architectural decisions, manage multi-billion-dollar budgets, or navigate intricate regulatory environments—all prerequisites for a VP of Engineering at a Fortune 100 firm. \n\nIf the goal is to prepare candidates for the highest levels of technical leadership, the system must evolve beyond simple behavioral questioning. It needs to actively interrogate the 'how' and 'why' of large-scale engineering governance. The current iteration is perhaps suitable for mid-management, but it is fundamentally inadequate for assessing executive-level strategic competence. The system must learn to be a skeptical, technically astute adversary, not a polite conversational partner.",
