  "rawFeedback": "This simulation, while structurally sound, failed fundamentally in the execution of a high-level technical interview. For a Director of Engineering role, I expect the interviewer to be a peer—a seasoned technologist capable of dissecting my architectural strategies and demanding evidence for my claims. The current system acts as a polite note-taker, confirming receipt of my answers but never engaging with the substance.\n\nThe most significant flaw lies in the response analysis. When I propose a tripartite solution or mention robust technical frameworks (SLOs, DevSecOps), the simulation must immediately pivot to the inherent difficulties, trade-offs, and failures associated with those concepts. Accepting my answers at face value is detrimental to the simulation's value. I need to be challenged on budget constraints, organizational resistance, and technical debt that inevitably accompany large-scale platform transformations.\n\nMoving forward, the system needs a critical overhaul to inject intellectual rigor. The questions are fine as starting points, but the subsequent dialogue must demonstrate a deep understanding of platform engineering and executive decision-making. Until the system can effectively challenge an 18-year veteran on the specifics of their proposed architecture, it remains unsuitable for high-level executive interview preparation.",
