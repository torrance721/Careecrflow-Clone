This quickly devolved into frustration and impatience due to the repetitive nature of the questioning.

  "rawFeedback": "As a highly demanding user seeking precise preparation for a top-tier consulting role, this mock interview was severely lacking. The primary failure lies in the tool's inability to maintain conversational coherence. The repetitive nature of the questioning, specifically asking for the baseline calculation three times in quick succession, demonstrated a fundamental flaw in the response analysis module. This is unacceptable for a tool designed to simulate intelligent, critical human interaction. I was forced to waste time re-explaining concepts instead of progressing the case study. \n\nFurthermore, the flow was non-existent. A 92-second interview is not a simulation; it is a fragment. The abrupt termination mid-technical discussion, followed by a generic, overly positive summary, indicates that the system prioritized speed over substance and structure. For a candidate targeting Management Consultant, the expectation is a rigorous, multi-faceted critique that challenges both technical depth and communication structure. This tool only managed to scratch the surface of technical depth before failing.\n\nTo be viable, the system must immediately prioritize fixing its state-tracking capabilities. It must be able to process complex, multi-part answers and generate subsequent questions that logically advance the discussion. Until then, the simulation lacks the necessary analytical rigor and structural integrity to be recommended for serious interview preparation.",
