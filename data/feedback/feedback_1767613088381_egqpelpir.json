        "Integrate more role-specific challenges, e.g., 'How would you use your PMM expertise to solve X common Shopify PM problem?'",

  "rawFeedback": "This mock interview was too fast, too generic, and ultimately, not rigorous enough to be truly useful. Completing 4 questions in 83 seconds is absurd; it felt like I was rushing through a checklist rather than engaging in a thoughtful professional conversation. I needed time to pivot my Product Marketing experience into the Product Manager context, and the system did not afford me that space. The repeated reliance on the hint system (three times!) is a clear indicator that the flow was broken, yet the system didn't adapt to help me structure my thoughts better.\n\nThe feedback provided by the 'interviewer' was surface-level, consisting mostly of generic affirmations like 'fantastic explanation.' If I am paying for critical analysis, I expect to be challenged. I need actionable feedback on how to frame my PMM skills (like segmentation and analysis) in a way that directly addresses PM concerns (like roadmap prioritization and feature ownership), not just vague praise. The system failed to address my core anxiety about transitioning roles, which is a major oversight.\n\nTo improve, the system must slow down dramatically, offer specific and structural hints, and introduce critical challenges to test the depth of my answers. As a demanding user, I need constructive criticism that is clear and actionable, not just a quick, congratulatory pat on the back. This needs significant refinement to be a valuable preparation tool.",
