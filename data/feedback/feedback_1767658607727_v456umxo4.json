        "Excellent technical depth and rigor, focusing on statistics, sample sizes, and validation methods (p-values, Shapiro-Wilk, Levene's test).",
        "The questions maintained a consistent, high-pressure 'Let me challenge you on that' format, which tests resilience and precision.",
        "Successfully simulated the kind of deep dive expected for a VP-level technical leadership role."

      "weaknesses": [
        "The relentless focus on statistical rigor, while impressive, became repetitive and slightly artificial after the third challenge on N and p-values.",

      "suggestions": [
        "Introduce more variety in the challenge types (e.g., ethical dilemmas, resource allocation, cross-functional conflict) instead of solely statistical challenges.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The hints were requested twice in rapid succession, indicating the system pushed the technical boundary too far too quickly.",
        "The hints seemed to provide the exact technical answer needed (e.g., 'The complexity weighting was standardized against a baseline of 10...'), which is less about guiding thought and more about filling in a blank."

      "specificIssues": [
        "The system allowed for two hints in a very short, high-pressure segment, potentially masking a lack of genuine knowledge rather than testing recall under pressure."

      "weaknesses": [
        "The analysis was too literal, focusing exclusively on the numbers provided without sufficiently challenging the *implications* of those numbers (e.g., why $N=500$ was chosen for a major feature rollout)."
      ],
      "specificIssues": [
        "The system failed to recognize the candidate's attempt to pivot to strategic thinking at the end ('I would prioritize (B)... velocity is the multiplier') and immediately reverted to a summary."

  "rawFeedback": "The simulation successfully created an intense, technically rigorous environment appropriate for a VP of Engineering role. The interviewer demanded precision, forcing me to validate every claim with data (p-values, sample sizes, statistical tests), which is a crucial skill.\n\nHowever, the efficiency was low. After the second or third challenge on 'N' or 'p-value,' the exercise became repetitive and felt more like a memory test than a strategic dialogue. A VP interview should cycle between technical depth and strategic leadership; the system spent too much time in the weeds, reducing the opportunity to demonstrate high-level thinking.\n\nMoving forward, the system needs to prioritize structural flow and variety in challenges. The persona simulation was excellent, but the underlying question generation needs to be smarter about when to pivot back to strategic impact or organizational design, especially when the candidate attempts to steer the conversation that way.",
