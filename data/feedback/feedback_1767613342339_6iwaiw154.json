When the first question was a fundamental JS concept, I felt momentary relief, quickly followed by intense pressure as the AI drilled down into increasingly esoteric details.

The abrupt ending left me feeling frustrated and unassessed, like I failed to even get past the warm-up round due to flawed external pacing.",

  "rawFeedback": "This simulation was severely lacking in structure and depth. Ending the interview after barely over a minute, having covered only one highly detailed subtopic of JavaScript fundamentals, renders the entire exercise invalid as preparation for a demanding L3 role at Meta. I was just starting to warm up and recall the more complex aspects of Macrotasks when the session was abruptly terminated. This is unacceptable; a real interview would cover at least three distinct areas (e.g., JS, React, and System Design).\n\nFurthermore, the questions, while technically correct, lacked the practical context necessary for an engineering assessment. I felt like I was being tested on trivia rather than my ability to architect or debug complex systems. The system needs to be far more robust in simulating realistic pacing and ensuring comprehensive coverage. My nervousness was compounded by the feeling that the AI was rushing me through a checklist rather than engaging in a thoughtful technical discussion. I need practice handling pressure over a sustained period, not just a 60-second sprint.",
