  "rawFeedback": "The simulation provided a decent structural outline of a Senior PMM interview, covering the necessary domains: experience, positioning, competitive strategy, and execution. However, the execution was fundamentally flawed for a senior-level assessment due to the lack of critical analysis and challenge from the interviewer persona. I was able to deploy polished, high-level frameworks without ever being forced to defend their tactical feasibility or address realistic trade-offs.\n\nFor a candidate at my level, the value of a mock interview lies in being pushed beyond comfort zones, forcing synthesis and complex decision-making. This simulation felt more like a structured conversation than a rigorous evaluation. To be truly effective for senior roles, the system must evolve from merely acknowledging detailed answers to actively scrutinizing and challenging the underlying strategic assumptions. The rapid duration further underscores the superficiality of the interaction.",
