The middle phase became highly focused and intense, requiring rapid technical defense of architectural choices. The overall feeling was that of a demanding technical review, which is appropriate for a Lead role, but the speed was slightly exhausting.",

    "The rapid-fire transition from high-level strategy to low-latency stream processing details, which compressed too much technical depth into a short timeframe.",

  "rawFeedback": "The simulation was technically rigorous and highly relevant to the target role of Lead Recommendation Systems Scientist. The interviewer demonstrated excellent domain knowledge by consistently challenging responses on crucial production details like consistency, latency, and pipeline skew. This is exactly what a senior candidate expects.\n\nHowever, the flow was too aggressive and short. Covering MAB, diversity metrics, A/B testing methodology, Kafka/Spark/Flink architecture, RocksDB state management, and Redis transactional limits in under 140 seconds makes the experience feel like a rapid-fire technical quiz rather than a structured interview. While the intensity is appreciated, the pacing needs adjustment. The system should allow the candidate to breathe and fully articulate the rationale behind complex architectural decisions.\n\nOverall, the quality of the technical challenges was high, particularly the final push on strong consistency via Redis transactions. If the pacing is corrected, this tool would be invaluable for preparing for high-stakes technical interviews.",
