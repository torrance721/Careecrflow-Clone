        "The questions demonstrated an exceptional level of technical depth, moving far beyond typical behavioral or surface-level MarTech inquiries.",
        "The progression from basic scoring logic to advanced topics like constrained optimization and KL divergence was logical and rigorous.",
        "The questions were highly relevant to the transition from a specialist role (MAS) to a strategic manager role (Demand Gen), testing both tactical knowledge and analytical leadership."

      "specificIssues": [
        "The question regarding the feature weights not being included in the optimization (Question 7) felt like a slight misstep, as the optimization was specifically described as *constrained* to the output, not the input features themselves, suggesting a minor misunderstanding of the described methodology."

      "suggestions": [
        "Ensure the generated questions maintain a strong anchor in real-world platform limitations (e.g., API limits, database structures, native scoring engine constraints) even when discussing advanced models.",

      "weaknesses": [
        "The system occasionally focused too heavily on the mathematical purity of the solution rather than the operational justification, suggesting a slight disconnect between technical understanding and practical application analysis.",

      "specificIssues": [
        "The system failed to immediately recognize the specific operational necessity of the logarithmic floor function (Question 6/7) as a mechanism for *quantization* required by Marketo's integer-based scoring, requiring me to reiterate the operational constraint."

  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was an exceptionally rigorous and challenging mock interview, far surpassing the typical quality of AI-driven simulations. The system demonstrated a profound understanding of advanced MarTech concepts, successfully bridging the gap between Marketing Automation implementation and data science rigor. The questions on logistic regression, constrained optimization, and Feature Stability Index (FSI) were particularly impressive and highly relevant to a senior analytical role.\n\nHowever, the system struggled slightly with interpretive nuances. When I introduced highly specific technical solutions driven by platform limitations (e.g., the logarithmic floor function necessitated by Marketo's integer scoring), the follow-up questions sometimes focused on the mathematical purity of the function rather than the operational necessity. This suggests a minor weakness in linking abstract technical concepts directly to named MarTech platform constraints, which is crucial for evaluating a practitioner.\n\nDespite these minor interpretive gaps, the simulation was highly effective. I would recommend this tool, especially for candidates needing to practice defending complex, data-driven solutions. Addressing the critical suggestion regarding operational context linkage will elevate this system from excellent to truly indispensable for high-level technical screening.",
