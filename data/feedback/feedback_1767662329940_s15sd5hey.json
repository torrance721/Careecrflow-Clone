  "rawFeedback": "This simulation excels at providing a rigorous, technical stress test. The depth of the follow-up questions regarding statistical methodology, A/B testing, and lead scoring optimization was truly impressive and forced me to defend my decisions with precision. The persona simulation of a highly knowledgeable interviewer was spot on.\n\nHowever, the simulation suffers from tunnel vision. For a Marketing Manager role, the interview became too heavily weighted toward data science and statistical defense, neglecting crucial managerial competencies like strategic planning, team leadership, stakeholder management, and budget oversight. The overall evaluation felt incomplete because of this imbalance.\n\nMy primary disappointment lies in the final feedback. After enduring such a demanding, detailed cross-examination, the concluding summary was vague and lacked the specific, actionable guidance required for a candidate operating at this level. If the tool aims to prepare candidates for senior roles, the feedback must be equally critical, specific, and tied directly to the skills demanded by the job description.",
