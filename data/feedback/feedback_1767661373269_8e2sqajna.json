  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a very successful mock interview simulation. The questions were highly targeted towards the Mid-Level Business Intelligence Analyst role, covering necessary areas like strategic impact, data governance, and technical implementation (like data integration and ID standardization).\n\nThe professional tone was maintained throughout, making the experience feel realistic. The only minor area for improvement is the variation in conversational filler phrases used by the interviewer, which became slightly noticeable due to repetition. I would definitely recommend this tool for practicing job-specific interview responses.",
