  "rawFeedback": "The simulation demonstrated exceptional rigor in the 'question_generation' module, particularly in the rapid escalation of metric challenges. The demand for specific statistical data (sample size, confidence intervals, definition of accuracy) is highly commendable and accurately reflects the scrutiny expected in a Principal Operations Program Manager interview at Amazon. This level of detail provides genuine stress testing and forces the candidate to operate with high precision.\n\nHowever, the overall utility of the session was severely hampered by the brevity (97 seconds). A Principal-level candidate requires sustained pressure and the opportunity to articulate complex, multi-faceted solutions. Cutting the interview short prevents the AI from challenging the strategic long-term implications and scalability of the proposed solutions, focusing instead only on the initial tactical data validation. This lack of depth is a critical flaw for advanced users.\n\nMoving forward, the system must prioritize duration and structural analysis. The 'response_analysis' must explicitly verify adherence to the STAR method, and the 'question_generation' needs to evolve from merely validating numbers to challenging the underlying financial and strategic rationale for choosing those numbers. If this tool aims to serve demanding, experienced professionals, it must provide feedback that is equally demanding and actionable.",
