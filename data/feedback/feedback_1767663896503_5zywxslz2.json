  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the content of the interview was excellent. The questions were highly relevant to a Data Scientist I role, successfully testing both technical rigor (data imputation, edge cases) and business acumen (impact, recommendations). The persona simulation was professional and engaging.\n\nHowever, the primary issue was the speed. The entire conversation was far too fast, forcing me to prioritize brevity over clarity and structure. This made the experience feel rushed and artificial. I believe my technical explanations, while accurate, were likely too concise to fully satisfy a real interviewer, yet the system did not flag this.\n\nMoving forward, slowing down the pace is critical. Additionally, integrating guidance on response structure (like STAR) directly into the prompt will help candidates like me practice framing results more effectively without needing to use hints. I need to practice structuring my project results to immediately jump into the Situation, Task, Action, and Result, rather than needing a prompt to refocus.",
