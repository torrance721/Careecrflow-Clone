  "rawFeedback": "The overall experience was disappointing given the caliber of the role I am targeting. For an SDE III interview simulation, the system failed to deliver the required level of technical rigor and adversarial questioning. The conversation stalled almost immediately, forcing me to use hints just to escape the repetitive loop of 'tell me about the write path.' The total duration of 116 seconds is unacceptable and demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the pacing and progression logic. I was prepared to discuss complex topics like distributed consensus, eventual consistency trade-offs, and specific database sharding strategies, but the interviewer never progressed beyond basic component identification.\n\nTo be effective for senior candidates, the AI must act like a senior engineer: challenge assumptions, introduce conflicting constraints (e.g., high write throughput vs. strong consistency), and demand quantitative justification for every design choice. Accepting a claim like '5ms processing time' without immediately asking 'What specific kernel or network optimizations enable that?' is a failure of the response analysis module. This tool needs significant refinement to move from a basic Q&A script to a truly challenging technical interview environment.",
