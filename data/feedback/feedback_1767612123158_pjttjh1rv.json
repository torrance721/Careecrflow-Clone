  "rawFeedback": "The system shows strong potential, particularly in generating questions appropriate for an executive role. The topics covered—strategic alignment, future vision, execution at scale, and organizational change—are precisely what a VP candidate needs to practice. The initial setup is commendable.\n\nHowever, the execution fell short of the standard required for true executive practice. The interview was far too short, and the AI acted as a passive listener rather than an active, challenging interviewer. For a candidate with 20 years of COO experience, the value of the practice lies not in answering the initial question, but in successfully navigating the subsequent pressure-testing and strategic challenges posed by the interviewer. The current model fails to deliver this crucial outcome.\n\nTo be truly valuable for executive preparation, the system must prioritize depth and rigorous challenge over speed. The feedback provided by the AI must also evolve beyond generic compliments to focus on the strategic frameworks, risk identification, and measurable impact discussed in the candidate's response.",
