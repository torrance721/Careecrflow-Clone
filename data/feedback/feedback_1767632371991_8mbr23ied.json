  "rawFeedback": "This mock interview failed to provide a rigorous assessment suitable for a Principal Research Scientist role. The core issue lies in the system's inability to process and iterate on complex technical information. I introduced concepts like QAOA, NP-hard problems, approximation ratios, and hardware noise profiles, but the interviewer consistently ignored these high-value signals, defaulting to requests for 'operational' or 'resource' details. This forced me to repeatedly provide the technical context and then answer the resulting management question, which is an inefficient use of time and fails to test my actual research capabilities. The analysis engine appears to prioritize structural completeness over technical correctness or depth.\n\nThe flow was jarring. A professional interview, especially at this level, requires respect for the candidate's ability to structure a complex answer. The immediate interruption was unnecessary and indicative of poor conversational logic. If the system cannot handle a detailed, jargon-heavy response, it should not be simulating interviews for roles requiring such precision. The feedback provided by the 'Lead Hiring Manager' was too complimentary and lacked the critical edge expected when evaluating a candidate for a role that demands domain mastery.\n\nFor future iterations, focus on increasing the technical 'density' of both the questions and the analysis. If a candidate mentions a specific algorithm or hardware constraint, the system must be capable of challenging that choice or asking for implementation details. As it stands, this simulation is adequate for testing basic communication skills but completely insufficient for evaluating a Principal-level technical strategist.",
