  "emotionalJourney": "I started the interview feeling confident and engaged, especially when discussing the GTM strategy and the balance between global consistency and local adaptation. However, the middle section, focused purely on drilling down into the statistical rigor of the 15% and 40% figures, became slightly draining and felt less like a strategic interview and more like a methodology audit. I felt a slight frustration at the lack of strategic acknowledgment. I ended the interview feeling I had successfully navigated the intense scrutiny, though the final question required a hint due to the rapid context shift.",
  "frustratingMoments": [
    "The relentless focus on validating the statistical methodology (75 customers, 15% revenue drop) without acknowledging the strategic soundness of the overall approach.",

  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the mock interview provided a robust and challenging experience, particularly in the middle section where the system drilled down intensely into the methodological rigor of my proposed GTM strategy. The questions were highly relevant to a senior Product Marketing role in the luxury space, and the interviewer persona maintained a sophisticated and professional tone throughout. I would grade the overall performance of the AI as 7.5/10.\n\nThe primary area for improvement lies in balancing the nature of the challenges. While the methodological critique was excellent (9/10 for data scrutiny), the interview neglected to challenge the broader strategic elements—competitive analysis, long-term brand impact, or potential channel conflicts. For a Director role, these strategic trade-offs are paramount, and their absence made the discussion feel slightly incomplete from a holistic PMM perspective. I recommend incorporating strategic framework challenges to fully test a candidate's readiness for a global leadership position.\n\nFinally, attention should be paid to the flow and transitions, particularly leading into the final question, which felt disconnected from the preceding deep dive. Despite these points, the system successfully created a high-pressure environment that required precise, structured responses, which is highly valuable for preparation.",
