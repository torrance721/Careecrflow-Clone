  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the framework for the interview is strong. The questions themselves were appropriate for a Senior Investment Strategist role at a firm like Fidelity, touching on necessary areas like risk, distribution, and innovation. This foundational relevance is a major strength and why I would still recommend the tool.\n\nHowever, the execution of the conversation severely undermined the simulation's value. The AI's responses were excessively repetitive and lacked any critical engagement. In a real-world finance interview, especially at this level, candidates are expected to defend their strategies with data, and the interviewer is expected to probe for weaknesses or alternative viewpoints. The current simulation accepts broad, high-level answers without challenge, which is a significant flaw for senior-level preparation. The extremely short duration also broke the immersion.\n\nTo improve, the system must introduce conversational variety and, more importantly, a critical layer of analysis where the interviewer challenges the candidate’s assumptions and demands specific, quantitative proof. This shift from passive affirmation to active, critical engagement is necessary to prepare candidates for the rigor of a high-stakes finance interview.",
