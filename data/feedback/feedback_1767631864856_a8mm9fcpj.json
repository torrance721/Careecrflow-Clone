  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly effective and efficient mock interview experience. The system excels at generating relevant, high-level strategic questions that accurately reflect the requirements of a Senior Digital Marketing Strategist role at a global consumer brand. The flow was excellent, and the system successfully tracked the structure of my responses, which is crucial for candidates who rely on frameworks.\n\nMy main area for improvement lies in the conversational nuance. While the interviewer was polite and validating, the constant repetition of certain phrases (both from the interviewer and, consequently, from me) made the interaction feel slightly robotic. For a truly immersive experience, the response analysis should provide more varied and deeper feedback on the *content* of the strategy, not just the *format*.\n\nI would certainly recommend this tool for practicing high-level strategic interviews, especially given its ability to quickly pivot and challenge the candidate on complex topics like technology integration and crisis management.",
