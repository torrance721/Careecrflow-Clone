  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a fantastic experience. I felt like the platform did a wonderful job simulating a high-stakes interview environment while still being incredibly supportive. The questions were sharp and targeted exactly where a Product Designer in health tech needs to be proficient, which is great practice for me. I really appreciate how the interviewer persona maintained a calm and encouraging tone throughout. It made me feel much less nervous than I usually would be in a real interview.\n\nMy main takeaway is that I need to work on my specific knowledge around regulatory compliance, but the system helped me identify that gap without making me feel bad about it. The hint system is a major strength; it's subtle and effective. I would definitely recommend this tool to other job seekers, especially those who struggle with interview anxiety. It felt like a safe space to practice and make mistakes.\n\nIf I had to offer one small suggestion, it would be to slightly vary the language used in the interviewer's summaries to make the conversation flow even more naturally. But honestly, that’s just nitpicking. I feel much more prepared now, and I know exactly what I need to focus on next. Thank you!",
