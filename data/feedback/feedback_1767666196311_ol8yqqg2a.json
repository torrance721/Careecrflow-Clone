  "rawFeedback": "This was an exceptionally strong mock interview, particularly regarding the technical depth. The tool successfully simulated an interview for a Senior Software Developer role focused on distributed systems and high-reliability payment processing. The questions were relevant, challenging, and demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of patterns like Sagas, idempotency, and DynamoDB consistency models.\n\nThe most valuable aspect was the interviewer's ability to drill down. They didn't accept high-level answers; they forced me to discuss specific implementation details like `ConditionExpression` usage, key design (`TransactionID` and `StepNumber#AttemptID`), and the dangers of type coercion (DynamoDB Number type). This rigor is exactly what is needed for a senior-level assessment.\n\nMy primary area for suggested improvement is the hint system. While the hints were technically correct, they were too generic for the level of specificity the interviewer was seeking. When a candidate is stuck on a detail like 'how to ensure type integrity in a DynamoDB update,' the hint should guide them closer to the required solution rather than just reiterating the problem of race conditions. Overall, however, this tool is highly effective and I would recommend it to peers preparing for similar technical roles.",
