  "rawFeedback": "This simulation, while covering the standard breadth of a Data Science interview (modeling, experimentation, strategy), fails dramatically on depth and pace. The entire 128-second duration is unacceptable for a technical screening for a Mid-Level role at a company like ByteDance. A real interview requires 45-60 minutes to adequately probe the candidate's understanding of trade-offs, statistical rigor, and system architecture. The rapid-fire nature prevented any meaningful discussion, forcing me to provide superficial answers that were then accepted without challenge.\n\nFurthermore, the interviewer's feedback was overly positive and generic. I used hints on two complex questions, yet this was not noted in the final summary. The lack of critical follow-up on my A/B testing design (e.g., sample ratio mismatch, network effects, OEC selection) suggests the underlying model cannot effectively assess technical nuance. If this tool aims to prepare candidates for top-tier tech companies, it must significantly increase its criticalness and demand for detail, mirroring the standards found in resources like 'Designing Data-Intensive Applications' or advanced statistical texts, which I constantly reference.",
