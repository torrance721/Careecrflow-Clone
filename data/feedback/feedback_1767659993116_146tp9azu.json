  "emotionalJourney": "I felt engaged and intellectually challenged throughout the session. Initially, I was confident explaining the project, but as the interviewer drilled deeper and deeper into the financial modeling specifics (WACC, DCF, hurdle rate justification), I started to feel slightly defensive and had to rely on hints to navigate the specific technical demands. The feeling was one of intense focus and pressure, similar to a real high-stakes interview where the interviewer is testing the limits of your knowledge.",
  "frustratingMoments": [
    "The relentless focus on justifying the 1.5% premium on the WACC. While relevant, it felt like the AI was stuck on this single technical point.",

  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly engaging and challenging mock interview. The AI demonstrated exceptional ability to analyze complex, technical responses and drill down with financial rigor. The level of detail required regarding WACC, DCF, and risk quantification was impressive and highly relevant to the financial aspects of a Senior Operations role.\n\nHowever, the interview lacked balance. It became a single, intense interrogation focused almost exclusively on the financial justification of one project, neglecting other critical areas for a Senior Ops Specialist like strategic planning, team leadership, or cross-functional governance. I had to use three hints because the line of questioning became hyper-focused on financial modeling methodology, which felt restrictive. For future simulations, I recommend diversifying the topics covered to better reflect the breadth of a senior-level position.\n\nDespite the narrow focus, the professionalism and analytical depth of the interviewer simulation were excellent. I appreciated the specific, challenging nature of the follow-ups, which forced me to think critically and justify every assumption I made.",
