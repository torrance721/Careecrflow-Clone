  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the system is functional and covers the necessary ground, but it desperately needs a human touch. The speed was the biggest inhibitor to a good experience. It felt like I was racing against a timer, which is counterproductive for practicing thoughtful, nuanced answers. I’m a UX Designer, and the user experience here felt optimized for machine efficiency, not human comfort.\n\nI think the core content—the questions themselves—are solid, but the delivery is cold. If the goal is to simulate a real interview, the system needs to breathe. Real interviews have pauses, tangents, and moments where the interviewer validates the candidate's feelings. Without that, it’s just a glorified flashcard session.\n\nI really hope the team focuses on making the flow feel more organic. The technology is clearly capable of tracking data points, but it needs to learn how to track the emotional journey of the candidate too. It's about empathy, which is what we preach in design, right? The system needs more radical empathy.",
