  "rawFeedback": "This mock interview demonstrated a high capability for generating specific, technically challenging follow-up questions based on candidate input. However, the experience was fundamentally flawed by a severe misalignment between the target role (Senior Product Designer) and the interview content (Data Architecture/DevOps). The system quickly locked onto technical keywords and failed to pivot back to core design competencies, rendering the majority of the interaction irrelevant to my actual job function. This lack of contextual awareness significantly degrades the utility of the simulation.\n\nFurthermore, the analytical feedback provided by the system was superficial. A real, demanding interviewer would have identified my repetitive verbal patterns and challenged the lack of detailed design artifacts in my responses. The system's praise for 'Exceptional technical depth' missed the point entirely; my goal was to showcase design leadership, not my ability to troubleshoot S3 Select queries. If this tool is intended for senior professionals, it must move beyond surface-level content analysis and provide prescriptive critique on delivery, structure, and strategic alignment.\n\nIn summary, the pressure simulation was effective, but the content accuracy was poor. Future iterations must prioritize role-specific constraints and implement a robust delivery analysis module to be truly valuable to a candidate operating at this level.",
