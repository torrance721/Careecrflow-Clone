  "rawFeedback": "This simulation failed to deliver a realistic or challenging technical interview experience due to a critical flaw in the question generation module. The interview devolved into an unproductive loop where the AI repeatedly asked the same question about statistical stability and variance reduction, demonstrating a severe lack of conversational state management and topic diversity. For a Junior AI/ML Engineer role at a company like ByteDance, I expect to be tested on model lifecycle, system design, scaling, and specific infrastructure concerns. None of these critical areas were touched upon.\n\nThe repetitive nature of the questions not only wasted my time but also masked the potential effectiveness of the hint system and response analysis. I was forced to request hints on redundant queries, which is a poor use case. The simulation needs immediate refinement to ensure topic rotation and to integrate questions that reflect the actual demands and technical environment of the target company. As a demanding candidate, I rate this experience as significantly below the expected standard for a high-fidelity interview preparation tool.",
