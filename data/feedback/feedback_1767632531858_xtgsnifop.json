  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the mock interview served as a decent strategic overview, successfully covering the key thematic areas required for a Series B Investment Associate role. The questions were relevant, focusing on scaling, defensibility, and market dynamics, which is appropriate for the target role.\n\nHowever, the simulation fell short in two critical areas, likely due to the extremely short duration. First, the response analysis was too superficial; the interviewer accepted every answer without challenge or deeper inquiry, which is unrealistic for a high-stakes VC interview. Second, given my background and the seniority of the role, there was a noticeable absence of technical rigor. I was prepared to discuss specific financial modeling techniques, non-GAAP metric analysis, and complex valuation methodologies, but the questions remained high-level and strategic. This limits the utility of the assessment for someone transitioning from a technical finance background.\n\nTo improve, the system needs to incorporate more challenging follow-up questions and ensure that the question generation module includes mandatory technical checks for roles where quantitative skills are paramount. While the structure was sound, the lack of depth made the experience feel like a quick screening rather than a comprehensive evaluation.",
