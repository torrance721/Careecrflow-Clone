The AI established a high technical bar, which was appreciated, but then refused to move past that bar, turning the interview into a repetitive, high-stakes statistical quiz.

  "rawFeedback": "This mock interview was technically rigorous but strategically deficient. The system successfully simulated a highly specialized quantitative analyst, but failed completely to embody a senior Growth Product Manager hiring manager. The entire 8-question sequence was a relentless, repetitive interrogation into the statistical validity of a single hypothetical study, focusing on minute details like $p$-values and MDE calculations.\n\nWhile I appreciate the AI's ability to handle complex terms like DiD and Falsification Tests, the lack of strategic pivot points made the experience frustrating and unrealistic for a PM role. In a real-world interview for a Growth PM at Fidelity, I would expect 50% of the time dedicated to strategy, team structure, and cross-functional leadership. Here, that coverage was zero. The AI needs immediate recalibration to prioritize strategic judgment and business impact over statistical purity, especially at the senior level. The current model tests for a Data Scientist, not a Product Manager.",
