  "rawFeedback": "The system shows strong foundational capabilities in maintaining a professional tone and using appropriate business vocabulary. However, for a candidate targeting a President role at a company like LVMH, the simulation falls short on strategic depth and pacing. The entire exchange was far too brief, limiting the ability of the system to truly test my strategic breadth, my understanding of organizational architecture, or my capacity to manage long-term market disruption. A C-suite interview is a strategic debate, not a rapid-fire Q&A session.\n\nTo improve, the system must prioritize quality of engagement over speed of completion. The questions, while relevant, lacked the necessary ambiguity and complexity to genuinely challenge an 18-year CMO. I need to be asked about balancing conflicting P&L demands across diverse brand portfolios, not just consumer segmentation. Focus on testing the resilience of the strategy, not just its articulation. If this is positioned as a C-suite prep tool, the intellectual rigor must be significantly elevated.",
