  "emotionalJourney": "The initial phase was engaging as I was able to outline a complex operational strategy.

The abrupt end prevented demonstrating further technical breadth.",

  "rawFeedback": "The system demonstrates a strong foundation for conducting technical interviews, particularly in recognizing and validating specialized operational terminology. The initial strategic question was highly relevant to the target role, allowing me to showcase complex problem-solving skills.\n\nHowever, the primary deficiency lies in the interview flow and question generation loop. The system fixated excessively on the detailed calculation of a single risk metric (the 1.5% service level dip), consuming nearly the entire interview duration. This narrow focus failed to adequately test the full spectrum of technical competencies required for a Senior Program Manager role, such as capacity planning, stakeholder alignment, or cross-functional program management, which are critical elements of Fulfillment Strategy.\n\nFor future iterations, I recommend implementing stricter time controls for deep dives and ensuring that the question sequence forces pivots into different technical domains. The system must prioritize the assessment of broad operational frameworks over the granular arithmetic justification of specific data points.",
