  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was an exceptionally strong simulation, particularly for a Senior Product Manager role in a highly technical domain like Fintech. The interviewer successfully pushed me to defend my decisions across multiple axes: business impact, risk management, regulatory compliance, and system performance (latency).\n\nThe depth of the technical questioning—specifically around the P99 metrics and the implementation of the Compliance Watchdog—was the biggest strength. It forced me to move beyond high-level strategy and articulate the underlying engineering trade-offs, which is crucial for a Senior role. The simulation felt realistic and challenging.\n\nMy primary constructive feedback relates to the hint system. While I appreciated the help, the hints occasionally felt too direct. For a high-level candidate, the system should aim to challenge the candidate's thinking process rather than providing technical details. Focus on guiding the structure of the answer to maximize the learning experience.",
