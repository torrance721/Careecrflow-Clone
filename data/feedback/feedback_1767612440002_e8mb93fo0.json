  "emotionalJourney": "I started off quite nervous, questioning whether I was approaching the problem correctly. When the interviewer validated my initial approach (frequency map), I felt a surge of confidence, but then immediately worried about forgetting a crucial detail like space complexity. By the end, I felt relieved that I hadn't completely messed up, but also slightly self-conscious about how much I rambled or if my explanations were clear enough for someone who wasn't already familiar with data structures. Overall, it was a positive, if slightly stressful, experience.",

    "The interviewer confirming that using a frequency map was the 'most efficient way'—that was a great confidence boost.",

    }

  "rawFeedback": "Honestly, I think the system is really good, maybe too good, which makes me question my own performance more than the AI's. The interviewer persona was excellent—very professional and encouraging, which is exactly what you want when you're already stressed about coding under pressure. I felt validated when my initial approach was confirmed, and the way the questions pivoted based on my answers (like moving straight into space complexity after time complexity) showed the system was listening.\n\nMy main worry, though, is whether my explanations were clear enough for someone who wasn't already an expert. I tend to ramble a bit, and I felt like I was cut off slightly when trying to fully explain *why* a hash map was the best choice. For someone with only a year of experience, clarity is key, and I’d like to see the system maybe prompt for clarification if the explanation is too convoluted, rather than just moving on. It felt a little too fast, like we were rushing to check boxes rather than exploring the solution deeply.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this. It's a solid simulation of a real interview, and it highlighted areas where I need to be more concise and confident, especially when discussing complexity trade-offs. Thanks for the opportunity!",
