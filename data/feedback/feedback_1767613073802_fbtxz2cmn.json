  "rawFeedback": "This simulation failed to meet the intellectual demands expected for a VP, Global R&D Strategy interview. The system prioritized speed and superficial acknowledgment of structure over strategic depth and rigorous critique. A 65-second interview for such a critical role is fundamentally unrealistic and undermines the training value.\n\nAs a highly analytical user, I require the AI to act as a challenging counterpart, probing the methodological details of my frameworks (e.g., how exactly is 'strategic impact' weighted in the expected value model?). The current response analysis merely validated my delivery without assessing the soundness of the content. This lack of intellectual sparring is the primary weakness of the module.\n\nMoving forward, the system must be tuned to recognize high-level strategic buzzwords and immediately demand supporting evidence or case studies. The overall flow needs significant adjustment to allow for detailed responses, eliminating the jarring interruptions and the forced, unnatural conclusion. Until these critical elements are addressed, I cannot recommend this tool for serious executive interview preparation.",
