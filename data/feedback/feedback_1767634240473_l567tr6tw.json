  "rawFeedback": "As a candidate with seven years of experience, I appreciated that the questions targeted the core competencies of an Investment Associate role—modeling, diligence, and value creation. The structure was sound, and the AI managed to hit all the necessary points.\n\nHowever, the execution was severely hampered by the pacing. The total duration of 110 seconds for six complex questions is insufficient. This resulted in a highly rushed, transactional feel where I felt unable to provide the necessary technical depth. I was often cut off, or the AI moved on too quickly after a high-level summary, suggesting the system was prioritizing checklist completion over genuine technical assessment. The feedback from the AI was also overly complimentary, which reduced the feeling of being genuinely challenged, a key expectation in a high-stakes interview.\n\nTo improve, the system must slow down significantly, allowing for detailed responses, and the response analysis module needs to be tuned to demand more substantiation for claims. The one moment of true challenge—the question about strategic integration—demonstrates the system's potential when it probes underlying assumptions, and this should be the standard, not the exception.",
