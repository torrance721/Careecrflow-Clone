  "rawFeedback": "As a candidate targeting a Lead Research Scientist role at a firm like DeepMind, I expect the mock interview to rigorously test my theoretical and practical depth. While the system demonstrated basic conversational competence and maintained a professional tone, the simulation fell significantly short on technical rigor. The most critical flaw was the brevity and abrupt conclusion of the interview; 69 seconds is simply insufficient to evaluate a candidate with 12 years of experience. This lack of duration suggests a fundamental issue in the flow control mechanism.\n\nFurthermore, the system failed to engage with the complex technical vocabulary I introduced. When I mentioned specialized hardware and novel architectures, the AI responded with generic praise rather than probing for details on implementation, trade-offs, or theoretical justifications. For a technical assessment tool, the inability to challenge or validate deep technical claims is a major limitation. To be truly valuable for senior technical candidates, the system must evolve beyond screening-level questions and implement dynamic, challenging follow-ups based on semantic analysis of the candidate's responses.",
