  "rawFeedback": "The system shows promise, but for a high-stakes target like a Private Equity Associate role at Blackstone, the current difficulty level is insufficient. I spent five minutes preparing for technical questions that never materialized, which is inefficient. The interview flow was too brief, concluding after only 73 seconds and four questions, leaving major gaps in the assessment. I need to be tested on my core competencies: LBO mechanics, valuation methodologies, and complex financial analysis. The current questions were strategic and behavioral 'softballs' that any candidate could handle.\n\nMoving forward, the system must prioritize rigor. If a candidate claims expertise in 'advanced data analytics' or 'operational efficiency,' the interviewer must immediately pivot to challenging, specific questions on those topics. Acknowledge my answers, but then force me to defend them. The professionalism is there, but the intellectual challenge is completely missing. Increase the technical density immediately.",
