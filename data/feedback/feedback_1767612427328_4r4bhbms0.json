  "emotionalJourney": "I felt moderately frustrated. The interview started strong with a relevant opening, but the need to request three hints in under two minutes, coupled with the interviewer's overly verbose transitions, made the process feel slow and inefficient. I was constantly trying to accelerate the pace and inject the necessary regulatory context, but the system seemed to prefer high-level strategic responses.",
  "frustratingMoments": [
    "Having to use three hints, which suggests the system was not aligned with my natural response style or the questions were poorly framed.",
    "The interviewer's overly positive and lengthy validation of my previous answer before moving to the next question.",

  "rawFeedback": "The interview felt like a rapid-fire check of keywords rather than a substantive discussion suitable for a Chief Risk Officer. While the topics covered were highly relevant—ranging from dynamic risk modeling to AI lending and synthetic data—the execution was flawed by low efficiency.\n\nThe system needs to prioritize speed and depth for executive candidates. The constant need for hints and the interviewer’s slow, overly validating responses severely hampered the flow. For someone with 18 years of experience in compliance, I expect the system to challenge my assumptions and push for concrete, regulatory-backed examples, not simply accept high-level strategic points. The 82-second duration is unacceptable for a role of this magnitude; the conversation must be extended and deepened.\n\nMy primary recommendation is to streamline the interviewer's dialogue and raise the bar for what constitutes a successful response, forcing candidates to demonstrate specific, detailed regulatory knowledge immediately.",
