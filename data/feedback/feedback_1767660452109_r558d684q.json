  "emotionalJourney": "The initial phase was engaging, as the interviewer quickly picked up on the financial details. However, the middle section became frustratingly repetitive, feeling less like a strategic PM interview and more like an accounting exam focused solely on labor cost allocation. I felt challenged to maintain composure and pivot back to strategic thinking, which required significant effort. The final question I posed helped regain control and ended the session on a high note of strategic thinking.",

  "rawFeedback": "This simulation successfully created a high-pressure, financially rigorous environment, which is commendable. The interviewer's ability to drill down into the specifics of my quantitative claims ($117k uplift, labor costs) was excellent and forced me to demonstrate true analytical depth, which is vital for a role at Stripe. The logical flow between questions was strong, turning a single example into a deep dive.\n\nHowever, the simulation suffered from a severe lack of balance. The interview devolved into an accounting audit focused on labor cost allocation, overshadowing critical PM skills like stakeholder management, product vision, and market analysis. For a tool designed to train future Product Managers, the focus needs to be on strategic decision-making frameworks, not just accurate financial modeling.\n\nTo improve, the tool must provide quantifiable feedback on my performance against established PM frameworks. Simply saying my rigor was 'exceptional' is insufficient. I demand metrics on my structural adherence, completeness, and clarity. The simulation needs to be demanding, but also structurally complete in its assessment methodology.",
