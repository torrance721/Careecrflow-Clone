  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the interview was technically sound and highly focused, which is appropriate for a Staff Applied Scientist role. The AI demonstrated a strong command of machine learning terminology and successfully tracked the complex quantitative details I provided, such as the AUC drop and the FNR reduction.\n\nHowever, the simulation needs refinement in its technical analysis depth. When I provided specific technical figures (like the 12 million parameter count for the LSTM or the details of INT8 quantization), the AI's follow-up questions were too generalized, often defaulting back to the high-level latency constraint rather than challenging the specific implementation choices. For a candidate at this level, the interviewer must probe the trade-offs inherent in those specific decisions. The abrupt ending also detracted from the overall experience, cutting off the technical discussion prematurely.\n\nI would recommend this tool, but with the caveat that the response analysis module needs tuning to be more aggressive and nuanced when a candidate provides highly specific technical data points.",
