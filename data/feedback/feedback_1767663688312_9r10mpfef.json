  "rawFeedback": "This was an excellent technical interview simulation, highly relevant for a Senior Backend role in a performance-critical environment like FinTech. The interviewer demonstrated a strong command of distributed systems, database internals, and concurrency challenges. I particularly appreciated the deep dive into the custom Redis-based concurrency layer, which went far beyond typical interview questions and challenged my understanding of edge cases and performance trade-offs. The progression from theoretical concepts (ACID) to practical implementation flaws (range overlap detection) was expertly handled.\n\nThe main area for improvement lies in the hint system, which, while functional, could be more surgical in guiding the candidate through complex, bespoke problems. At times, the hints felt too broad when a specific technical vulnerability was being probed. Overall, the simulation successfully created a high-pressure, high-stakes technical environment, and I would strongly recommend it for assessing senior engineering candidates.",
