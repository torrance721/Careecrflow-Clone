  "emotionalJourney": "I started focused and confident, detailing a complex incident. I became slightly frustrated when I had to request a hint due to an incomplete prompt.

  "rawFeedback": "Overall, this was a highly effective and technically rigorous mock interview. The tool excelled at drilling down into complex, multi-layered SRE topics, moving seamlessly from incident response to process validation and statistical analysis. This level of technical depth is exactly what is required for a Senior SRE candidate and forced me to articulate my experience with precision and supporting data.\n\nMy main critique is focused on polish and flow, rather than substance. The prompt ambiguity that led to a hint request needs fixing, as does the repetitive acknowledgment phrasing. For a tool aiming for realism, these minor inconsistencies detract from an otherwise stellar technical performance. I recommend it for candidates needing a serious technical challenge, but suggest refining the conversational dynamics to make the experience less mechanical.\n\nSpecifically, the ability of the tool to challenge the statistical validity of my claims (e.g., questioning the use of the t-test and demanding proof of process stability) was the strongest feature and validates its utility for high-level technical roles.",
