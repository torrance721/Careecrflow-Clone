  "rawFeedback": "Overall, the simulation demonstrated strong potential, particularly in the structuring and relevance of the questions. The progression from technical deep dive to strategic leadership was appropriate for a Staff Applied Scientist role, successfully touching on key areas like latency optimization and organizational alignment.\n\nHowever, the primary flaw was the extremely short duration. At 75 seconds, the interaction felt like a scripted exchange rather than a true interview. For a senior candidate, the interviewer needs to demonstrate rigor by critically challenging the architectural decisions and deployment choices mentioned. Accepting complex technical jargon without probing the inherent risks or alternatives diminishes the value of the simulation as preparation for a high-stakes interview.\n\nMoving forward, focusing on increasing the interaction time and injecting more critical, probing questions into the response analysis phase will significantly elevate the quality and realism of the mock interview experience.",
